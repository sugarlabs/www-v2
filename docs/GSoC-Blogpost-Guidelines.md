## Step 1: Create Your Author Profile (One-time setup)

Before writing your first blog post, you need to create an author profile that will be linked to all your posts.

1. **Create a new file** in `constants/MarkdownFiles/authors/` named `your-username.md`
2. **Use this template** and replace the placeholder information:

```markdown
---
name: "Your Full Name"
slug: "your-username"
title: "GSoC'25 Contributor"
organization: "SugarLabs"
description: "GSoC'25 Contributor at SugarLabs"
avatar: "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/YOUR_GITHUB_ID?s=400"
---

<!--markdownlint-disable-->

# About [Your Name]

## Experience

## Current Projects

## Connect with Me

- **GitHub**: [@your-username](https://github.com/your-username)
- **Email**: [your.email@example.com](mailto:your.email@example.com)
- **LinkedIn**: [Your Name](https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile)

- **Website**: [yourwebsite.com](https://yourwebsite.com) *(optional)*

```

## Step 2: Official GSoC Blog Post Template

Use the exact template below for every GSoC '25 week update. You can also find this under `constants/MarkdownFiles/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-GSoC_DMP_SSoC_Template.md`. Copy it into `constants/MarkdownFiles/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-gsoc-25-username-weekXX.md`, then fill in your details.

```markdown
---
title: "GSoC '25 Week XX Update by [Your Name]"
excerpt: "Brief description of this week's progress"
category: "DEVELOPER NEWS"
date: "2025-06-14"

## Updating Your Post

1. Change the frontmatter `category` from `"TEMPLATE"` to `"DEVELOPER NEWS"`.
2. Replace placeholder text:
   - **Week XX**, dates, PR/issue numbers, links, screenshot URLs.
   - Your project name, mentor usernames, reporting period.
3. Update `title`, `excerpt`, `date`, `slug`, `author`, `tags`, `image`.
4. The `author` field should point to your author file: `"@/constants/MarkdownFiles/authors/your-username.md"`
5. Please keep (`<!-- markdownlint-disable -->`) to disable any markdown linting.
6. Change the contents of the file accordingly.
7. **Remove the "Connect with Me" section** from your blog post - this information is now in your author profile.

- Add your file under `constants/MarkdownFiles/posts/`.
- Commit and open a PR titled:  
  ```
