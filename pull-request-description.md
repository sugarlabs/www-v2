# Pull Request: Fix Copy-Code Console Error

## 📝 Description

This PR fixes the console error in the copy-code utility that was generating unnecessary noise when no code content was found to copy. The changes improve cross-browser compatibility and provide user-friendly visual feedback instead of developer-focused console errors.

**Key Improvements:**
- Replace console.error with user-friendly visual feedback
- Add secure context check for modern clipboard API
- Enhance fallback method for older browsers and HTTP contexts
- Add mobile device support with setSelectionRange
- Implement visual success/error states on copy buttons
- Improve error handling with graceful degradation

Fixes console noise when copy operation fails and ensures copy functionality works across all browsers including Firefox, Safari, and older browser versions.

## 💭 Additional Notes

This fix addresses the user experience issue where developers would see console errors during normal website usage. The new implementation:

1. **Gracefully handles all browser scenarios** without generating console noise
2. **Provides immediate visual feedback** to users about copy success/failure
3. **Maintains backward compatibility** with older browsers
4. **Improves mobile experience** with enhanced text selection

The changes are minimal and focused, ensuring no breaking changes to existing functionality while significantly improving the user experience across all browsers and devices.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Before (Issues):
```javascript
if (!codeContent) {
  console.error('No code content found to copy'); // ❌ Console noise
  return;
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
if (!codeContent) {
  showErrorFeedback(button, 'No content to copy'); // ✅ User feedback
  return;
}
```

### Cross-Browser Compatibility:
- **Modern browsers (HTTPS)**: Uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`
- **Older browsers / HTTP**: Falls back to `document.execCommand('copy')`
- **Mobile devices**: Enhanced with `setSelectionRange()` for better text selection
- **Failed operations**: Visual feedback instead of console errors
