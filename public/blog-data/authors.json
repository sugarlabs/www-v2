That simple idea sparked something in me, and over the years, my love for computer science has only grown—especially while building a bunch of cool things along the way.\n\nI'm going to spend my summer working on the [Speak Activity](https://github.com/sugarlabs/speak). I will be refactoring the chatbot in the speak activity to use Gen-AI.\n\nAbout a month ago, I launched my personal portfolio website: [mebin.in](https://mebin.in/). It runs on an 8-year-old Raspberry Pi sitting at home 🤩, so apologies in advance if the site is occasionally slow or down (power cuts are a real pain). I ocassionally write blogs there.\n\nI'm also building a Bluesky client in the Nim programming language. I'm a strong advocate for education in technology.
