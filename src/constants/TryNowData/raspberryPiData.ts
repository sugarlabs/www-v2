SoaS offers a rich collection of educational activities, making it ideal for learners, and it benefits from regular security updates to ensure a safe and stable environment. Designed as a spin of the Fedora operating system, SoaS combines the flexibility of Fedora with the educational focus of Sugar. For setup instructions, refer to the SoaS/RPi documentation, which guides users through the process of downloading, installing, and running it on a Raspberry Pi.',
