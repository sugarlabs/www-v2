I enjoyed testing over 60+ activities with kids to get first-hand feedback, which had a positive impact in the way they approach problems. The fact that these activities are used by kids as a tool of learning motivates me to contribute more and more. I'm going to continue to contribute and be a part of Sugar Labs.",
