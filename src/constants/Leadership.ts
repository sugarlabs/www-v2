    name: 'Sebastian Silva',
    position: 'Board Member, Sugar Labs',
    bio: 'Sebastian Silva learned Logo as a 5-year-old child in a workshop in Lima in the 1980s. Later, he taught himself Basic, Pascal, Python, JS, etc... but most importantly, through exploring GNU/Linux, he became enamoured with the philosophy of Software Freedom. He went on to study Psychology to satisfy his curiosity. Soon, he was involved with the original Sugar deployments on OLPC laptops in Peru, Colombia, and Uruguay - organizing local groups to promote software freedom in the region. SomosAzucar initiative (a SL local lab) was responsible for the addition of Quechua, Aymara and Awaj√∫n system locales to GLIBC in order to support these deployments. Currently, Silva works as Senior Programming Coach at Laboratoria, a feminist organization. In his spare time, he has written a few programming-learning gadgets such as SUPER-8 and Jappy Creator, and he\'s the Software Curator for the laptop-deployment projects of Repurpose-IT.org. He misses having a viable constructivist learning environment that "free desktops" can use, so he has returned to the Sugar Labs board.',
