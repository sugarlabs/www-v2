## Background  
The Sugar Learning Platform (Sugar) was first developed as the software platform for the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) program, a spin-off project from the MIT Media Lab in 2006.  

The founders of OLPC, Nicholas Negroponte, Seymour Papert, and Walter Bender, promoted the idea that learning is not a luxury and that a lack of an educated society is not just an inconvenience. Learning is fundamental to a free society that aspires to be both prosperous and sustainable. All societies value the role that education plays in economic development, and education is essential to the survival of democratic societies.  

Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon, co-inventors of the Logo programming language (along with Wally Feurzeig), described their pioneering efforts to use the Logo language as a vehicle for introducing children to computational thinking. They defined it in terms of heuristics: things to think with and reflect upon.  

In 1971, Papert and Solomon published *“20 Things to do with a Computer”*, a catalog of project ideas ranging from robotics to music to visual arts. This work foreshadowed what today is often referred to as the *Maker Movement*. Almost 50 years ago, children were using Logo as a tool for the autonomous construction of meaningful artifacts and pursuing mastery in solving personally meaningful problems.

## Sugar Pedagogy  
>>> **“Learning is hard fun.”** – Marvin Minsky  
>>> **“A six-year-old child can become an expert.”** – Marvin Minsky  

In a 2008 essay questioning “general” education, Marvin Minsky proposed that we *“re-aim our schools towards encouraging children to pursue more focused hobbies and specialties—to provide them with more time for (and earlier experience with) developing more powerful sets of mental skills, which they later can extend to more academic activities.”*  

Minsky encourages children to construct multi-level *cognitive towers*, built upon:  
- Instinctive reactions  
- Learned reactions  
- Deliberate thinking  
- Reflective thinking  
- Self-reflective thinking  
- Self-conscious reflection  

These levels span agencies specializing in areas such as gaining knowledge from experience, planning and causal attribution, the construction of models, and identifying values and ideals.  

A focus on achieving meaningful goals—not just the accumulation of simple knowledge objects—exercises all levels in a cognitive tower, helping children *develop proficiencies that can be used in other domains*. As a model for learning, the levels within Minsky’s cognitive towers represent broadly applicable skills.  

Minsky’s towers are inherently complex and require a learner to be motivated and persistent in their construction—a process he once described as *"hard fun."*  

This aligns with research by Daniel Pink, who reviewed four decades of studies showing that motivation for learning comes from:  
1. **Autonomy** – the freedom to explore and express ideas  
2. **Mastery** – confidence and space to develop expertise  
3. **Purpose** – authentic problem-solving opportunities  

A key insight of Minsky, Papert, and Solomon is to give children tools they can explore, master, and apply to problems they care about. Children using Sugar are **motivated learners**, pursuing meaningful goals that help them build their own “cognitive towers.”
