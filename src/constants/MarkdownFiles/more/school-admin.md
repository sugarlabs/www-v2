## Student and teacher agency

Sugar provides the user with affordances (things we designed for the possibility of taking action by the user) and pathways to engage in developing skills. Sugar is not instructional curricula in part because curricula tend to reflect very local norms and needs, and as a consequence, are resistant to global solutions. 

Also, Sugar reflects an explicit rejection of instruction as a pedagogical framework. With Sugar, we try to give agency to the learner, knowing that in all likelihood, the institution of school would likely be trying to take away agency. At each design decision point, we asked ourselves:  
- *How will this impact the learning?*  
- *How will this impact the autonomy and agency of the learner and the teacher?*

Agency is made possible in part because of the choice of a software license, the **General Public License (GPL)**, which ensures that the learner has permission to both use Sugar and to modify it. 

We go a step further by giving the learner affordances to engage in software development and debugging, i.e., to exploit the license. We provide a context for encouraging the learner to take initiative, both by deliberately leaving the platform “incomplete” and by providing a social norm in which it is expected to take initiative. Even if it were possible to make Sugar “complete”, we would have chosen not to. We wanted there always to be “itches” needing to be scratched.  

In a related design decision, Sugar was never intended to be an endpoint in and of itself. Rather, we envisioned it as a waypoint along a lifelong journey of learning. We encourage our users to outgrow Sugar and even provide them with a means of advancing from the Sugar desktop, with its tools for exploration, to the **GNOME desktop**, with its more powerful tools for production.

## What using Sugar can do for your students and school?

The **Sugar Learning Platform** was designed to promote collaborative learning through tools and activities that encourage critical thinking. Sugar puts an emphasis on divergent thinking. A related goal is to make that thinking visible to the learner. 

Sugar equally promotes cultures of **expression and reflection**. With Sugar, we provide teachers and learners with a collection of open-ended tools and activities, applicable to problems of their own choosing.

### Sugar offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software based on three affordances:

1. **Sharing:**  
   Collaboration is a first-order experience. The interface always shows the presence of other learners who are available for collaboration. Sugar allows users to dialog, support, critique, and share ideas with each other.

2. **Reflecting:**  
   A "journal" records each learner’s activity. It is a built-in space for reflection and assessment of progress.

3. **Discovering:**  
   Sugar tries to accommodate a wide variety of users with different levels of skill in terms of reading and language and different levels of experience with computing by providing activities with a "low floor" and, where possible, "no ceiling."

>>> **“The only time collaboration is called cheating is when you are in school.” – Walter Bender**

Sugar drew inspiration for its activities and the fluid interface between activities from observing how the **free software community** collaborates. Software developers chat, socialize, play games, share media, and collaborate on media creation and programming in both formal and informal settings.

Sugar users are given access to a variety of commonly used tools for collaboration, e.g., **Chat and IRC**. By default, the IRC application opens into the `#sugar` channel on `irc.freenode.net`, where Sugar developers discuss their work.

## Reflection and assessment in the context of Sugar and interoperability with school administrative systems

In the early days of the development of the Sugar user interface, one of the biggest points of contention with the OLPC advisory board was when we told them that we were not going to use **file browsing** as the primary mode of navigation. We were asked,  
*"How will the children learn to use Windows?"*  
Our response was, *"Why do they need to learn to use Windows?"*  

Instead of browsing a filesystem, Sugar gives the user a **journal or notebook** into which one’s work is “kept” rather than “saved.” The interface tries to keep things that offer value automatically in the Sugar journal.

The primary function of the journal is as a **time-based view** of the activities of a learner. As with physical media, such as pen on paper, no explicit "saving" step is needed. The individual journal entries are treated much like pages in a **laboratory notebook**.

### Assessment in Sugar:
- **Digital Portfolio:**  
  Sugar journal entries are directly incorporated into **digital portfolios** to support reflection that can help students (as well as teachers and parents) be aware of their own learning.
- **Impact Measurement:**  
  Sugar acknowledges the need for **measurement and evaluation**. Sugar does not take a position on high-stake testing but advocates for an evaluation that looks more broadly than standardized tests.
- **Custom Metadata for Journal Entries:**  
  Teachers can know what tools a student may have used and how many iterations they made in creating an artifact.
