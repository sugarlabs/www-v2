## A Blog-style Retrospective

This week I implemented the Interpreter and integrated it with the Symbol Table and Memory Module.

---

## Goals for This Week

- Start working on the implementation of the Interpreter based on the TechSpec and DFD.  
- Begin coding the first components of the Interpreter, focusing on integrating it with the Symbol Table and Memory Module.  
---

## This Week's Highlights

1. **Interpreter Implementation**  
   - Successfully implemented the core components of the Interpreter, including the execution logic.
   - Integrated the Interpreter with the Symbol Table and Memory Module, allowing for dynamic variable management and memory allocation.

2. **Symbol Table Integration**  
   - Developed the Symbol Table to manage variable declarations and scope.
   - Ensured that the Interpreter can access and manipulate variables defined in the Symbol Table, enabling dynamic variable handling during program execution.

3. **IR-Instruction Classes Implemented**
   - There were 6 identified IR-Instruction classes that were implemented this week:
     - `sym_declare`
     - `sym_assign`
     - `sym_query`
     - `call`
     - `compare_jump`
     - `jump`

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Integrating the Interpreter with the Symbol Table:**  
  Faced challenges in ensuring seamless interaction between the Interpreter and the Symbol Table.  
  *Solution:* Collaborated closely with mentors to refine the integration process, ensuring that variable management is efficient and error-free.


---

## Key Learnings

- Gained practical experience in implementing an Interpreter and integrating it with a Symbol Table and Memory Module.
- Learned about the complexities of dynamic variable management and memory allocation in programming languages.

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Start with the TechSpec for the Compiler, focusing on the architecture and components needed for the static compilation process.
- Begin drafting the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Compiler to visualize data movement and interactions within the system.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to my mentors Anindya, Sumit, Devin, and Walter for their crucial guidance on compiler design principles and static compilation concepts. Their clarification on the AST-to-IR translation approach and emphasis on maintaining clean instruction generation patterns was essential for this week's successful progress.
