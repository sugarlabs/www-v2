# The results for the 2025-26 Sugar Labs board cycle have been determined.

The votes have been counted, and the [results](https://bettervoting.com/dp3xc7/) for the [2025-26 Sugar Labs board cycle](https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/11/22/elections-extension/) have been determined.

The winners are **Devin Ulibarri, Sumit Srivastava, and Sebastian Silva**. They have all been notified and have agreed to serve on the Board of Directors for the 2025-26 cycle. For this election, we used [bettervoting.com](https://bettervoting.com) after doing research on various voting systems. Please read our [original election announcement](https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/11/22/elections-extension/) for more information on how we decided upon this voting system.

The new members of the board will be filling the seats of two outgoing board members, **Lionel Lask√© and Alex Perez**, and one vacant seat.

The next election for three seats to the **2026-27 cycle** is planned for **August of next year**. All Sugar Labs members may vote, and members can:
- Run for election to the Board of Directors  
- Vote in the elections for the Board of Directors  
- Suggest referenda
