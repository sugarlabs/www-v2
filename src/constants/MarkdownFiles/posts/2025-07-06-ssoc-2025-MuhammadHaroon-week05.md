## This Week's Achievements

1. **Generated more samples using various prompts**  
   - I generated more samples using [various prompts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lxMHoiE-4YB5oDYlXfSP9TK5iXWkGYWC33ll8weJIO8/edit?usp=sharing). These samples were stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jee1MAmsyNddbh-pTIOX9K6Wctbd6Cf9?usp=drive_link) and shared with the mentors. The mentors scored the sounds using the following Google Sheets: [Walter's Score](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gzh7w2o8TeUUaePqOSlN2bt1T7fofFeRNoGzxq97PPM/edit?usp=sharing) and [Devin's Score](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ozwnBbXLQKZY_EQ-p7I4y0PRtzkqUauYOwstVnvjxFU/edit?usp=sharing). The scores that could be assigned were: bad (1), fair (2), and good (3). Both Devin and Walter gave an average score of 1.485, indicating that the overall output quality was closer to bad than fair. After reviewing the score, it became evident that a new model was needed.

2. **Explored FastAPI and AWS**  
   - I explored FastAPI for connecting the backend with the frontend and AWS for deploying our backend.

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Find another open-source model to generate high quality sound samples.
