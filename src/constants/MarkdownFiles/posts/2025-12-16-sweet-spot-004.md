### Explorations of gen-AI in education: Four live conversations

*May 2025*

In May, we hosted four live conversations exploring artificial intelligence in education. In particular, we looked at what is “artificial intelligence”, what AI-related things Sugar Labs has done in the past, and the role of generative AI in education. We invited Sugar Labs community contributors, both new and familiar, as well as Ken Kahn, PhD, author of *The Learner’s Apprentice: AI and the Amplification of Human Creativity*.

Led by new contributor Safwan Sayeed, a group of volunteer developers built a new homepage for Sugar Labs from the ground up.

## (Volunteer) Help wanted

Sugar Labs is seeking volunteer assistance in the following ways. Sustained, committed help in any of the following areas will help us grow as an organization. If you are passionate or curious to learn more about any of these roles, and are able to commit the time necessary, then we encourage you to apply. Send a notification of your interest to info@sugarlabs.org, including some information about yourself, what interests you about the volunteer role, and what experience/qualities make you a good candidate for the position.

Sugar Labs is a growing organization. We don't currently have the resources to hire people to fulfill these roles. Our hope is that we one day will be able to, but, for now, we are looking for volunteers who can work with the executive director and the board to work diligently to improve our operations. What we can provide, in return, for your help, is assistance in conducting your role and mentorship (especially in the case of technical roles). Plus, you'll gain the experience and satisfaction of working with an organization that aims to do good in society.
