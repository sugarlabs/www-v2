# Reflections as a Parent and Teacher: Sugar at Home and in the Classroom

As the year comes to a close, I wanted to take some time to reflect upon how I’ve used Sugar both in the classroom and at home. I have a few hopes in mind as I share my experience engaging with Sugar both as a teacher and a parent. One hope is that it will show a window into some of the more grounded work Sugar Labs has done this year.

Much of the most recent testimony that we’ve shared from the [Sugar Labs community](/@sugarlabs) has been centered around software development. While the success of students creating software is certainly important, the purpose of such progress is grounded in helping teachers teach and helping learners learn. Another hope is that the following vignettes will dispel doubts around the efficacy of the Sugar Learning Platform as an effective educational tool. This article will address those doubts directly. My third hope is that my experiences will inspire others—whether parents or teachers (or both)—to try Sugar themselves.

## The First Few Years as a Parent

My son Kai was born in 2017, but it was about three years before his birth that I became involved in Sugar Labs. It’s a story I’ve told in more depth before, but I became interested in Sugar Labs because of their unique approach to education. At the time, I was doing research on the _implications of software-freedom-in-education_, which led me to conclude that the freedoms granted to users in free/libre/open (FLO) source software have [profound positive implications for education](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/File:Education-needs-free-software.pdf). 

I attended a talk given by Sugar Labs founder Walter Bender, and we soon began working together to integrate music into [Turtle Blocks](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4027), in what is now known as the [Music Blocks visual programming language](https://www.sugarlabs.org/music-blocks/). Around this time in 2014, I received a One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) laptop from Walter that I used to familiarize myself with the Sugar Learning Platform.

Although I had shown Kai a few things on the OLPC when he was a toddler—such as creating a paint program for him in Turtle Blocks—it wasn’t until he was about four years old that he really took to it. His first, most sustained, interest in the computer came when he was learning to read by himself. I remember his desire to read was basically insatiable.

At four years old, Kai had memorized much of the _Dog Man_ series by [Dav Pilkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dav_Pilkey), but wasn’t yet independently reading. That changed when he discovered the [Speak Activity](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4038) on his OLPC.

The Speak Activity reads back what the user types. Kai started walking around the house, typing words he saw on labels, signs, and books, and listening to the computer speak them back. This led to him memorizing spellings, creating his own sentences, and
