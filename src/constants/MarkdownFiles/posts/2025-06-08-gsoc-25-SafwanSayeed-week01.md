## A Blog-style Retrospective

Last week marked the official start of the coding phase for the Music Blocks 4 Program Engine. I spent the first few days translating our planning sessions into a concrete technical specification. Crafting the spec helped me clarify the core constructs, their key properties, and how they will map to interfaces. The early draft already feels like a solid roadmap for the engine’s evolution.

Midweek, I teamed up with Karan Palan to begin coding the skeleton of our abstract classes. We paired on Replit to code the classes.

## Goals for This Week

- Draft a comprehensive tech spec detailing engine constructs, class interfaces, and example workflows.  
- Implement the initial set of abstract classes in TypeScript.  
- Outline AST build steps and prepare a simple program example.

---

## This Week’s Highlights

1. **Tech Specification Draft**  
   - Wrote the first section of the tech spec covering .  
   - Link: [Tech Spec Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_MCCgl-RqiEQH0UQ4EX-2O6G4iRxgHAY1rZpw3QPXT0/edit?tab=t.otbw6ldsc32w)

2. **Abstract Classes Implementation**  
   - Started coding the core abstract classes in TypeScript alongside [Karan Palan](https://github.com/Karan-Palan).  
   - Link: [Replit: Engine Abstract Classes](https://replit.com/@karanpalan007/engine-abstract-classes?v=1#README.md)

3. **AST Discussion & Planning**  
   - Held discussions with Anindya on AST constructs, class instantiation workflow, and example program build.  
   - Outlined next steps for documenting AST examples in the tech spec.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Syncing Edits on Replit:**  
  We initially clashed on file versioning.  
  *Solution:* Established a clear editing schedule and used commit comments to track changes.

- **Defining Spec Scope:**  
  The broad set of music constructs felt overwhelming.  
  *Solution:* Prioritized a core subset to include in the first draft.

---

## Key Learnings

- Mastered TypeScript abstract classes and interface patterns.  
- Reinforced the importance of early design documentation.  
- Gained clarity on AST building workflows through Anindya's feedback.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Finalize abstract class implementations and interfaces.  
- Expand the spec with AST examples and UML class diagrams if needed.
