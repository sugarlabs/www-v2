## About Sugar Labs

Sugar LabsÂ® is a US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a global mission to create educational opportunities in technology for youth around the world.

Volunteer mentors and contributors work together to develop activity-focused software for children. All software is developed with learning as the primary goal, necessitating the need for source code to be published publicly for study, licensed under a free/libre license for explicit permission to share and remix, and openly worked upon within a community where students are invited to make contributions, under guidance of experienced mentors.
