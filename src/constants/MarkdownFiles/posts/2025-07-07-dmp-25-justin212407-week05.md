## Goals for This Week

- Set up the core **Playground UI** to serve as the editable workspace  
- Build a **Palette** with available brick types and integrate it visually into the Playground  
- Enable **drag-and-drop interactions** from the palette into the workspace  

---

## This Weekâ€™s Highlights

### 1. **Playground Workspace Setup**

Created a dedicated layout component for the brick workspace:
- Positioned using CSS grid to support side-by-side palette and canvas
- Styled with scrollable overflow to allow panning and scaling in future updates
- Prepares the base for rendering brick instances using spatial coordinates  


### 2. **Brick Palette UI**

Added Palette UI to playground:
- Lists all brick types with color-coded icons and labels
- Styled for compact visibility, allowing quick scanning of available bricks
- Each brick is draggable and includes metadata for `type`, `defaultProps`, and visual ID

ðŸŽ¨ Gives users clear visual feedback about available building blocks before use

### 3. **Drag-and-Drop from Palette to Playground**

Implemented full drag-and-drop pipeline:
- **OnDragStart**: Attaches metadata (`type`, `defaultProps`) to the drag event
- **OnDrop**: Computes drop position relative to workspace container
- **Dispatch**: Triggers creation of a new brick model at the drop location via Recoil

Supports extensibility for:
- UUID generation
- Position snapping
- Drag preview overlays

---

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Drop positioning was inaccurate due to nested containers and scroll  
**Solution:** Used `getBoundingClientRect()` to normalize the offset and compute absolute drop coordinates

**Challenge:** Drag behavior caused unwanted rerenders across unrelated components  
**Solution:** Memoized drag metadata using `useRef` and lifted shared handlers to a centralized manager  

---

## Key Learnings

- **Component Composition**  
  Learned how to break large UI logic into isolated playground, palette, and renderer components for clarity

- **Event Normalization**  
  Understood how native drag events behave in nested layouts and how to calculate relative drop points robustly

- **State Orchestration**  
  Tied together UI state (hover/drag) and business state (brick model updates) using Recoil and internal `BrickFactory` functions

---

## Next Weekâ€™s Roadmap

- Implement dragging of bricks in the playground.
- Implement Collision Maps for colliding objects.
- Create a reverse mapping utility file to fetch all connection points.
