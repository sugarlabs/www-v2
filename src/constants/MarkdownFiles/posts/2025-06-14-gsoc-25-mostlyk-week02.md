# Week 2: Strategic Pivot and Foundation Building

**Project:** [GTK4 Exploration](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/rsHsYZKy)  
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Ibiam Chihurumnaya Ibiam](https://github.com/chimosky), [Juan Pablo Ugarte](https://github.com/xjuan)       
**Reporting Period:** June 06, 2025 till June 14, 2025

## The Meeting that changed everything

On Friday(06-06-2025), we had a pivotal video call with Juan Pablo Ugarte and Ibiam Chihurumnaya that completely reshaped the porting approach.
What started as a discussion about my initial porting work evolved into something much more strategic and forward-thinking.

> While the time of writing this, another meet that happened on 13-06-2025 , we discussed about the API versioning and updating with pytest, ideas about testing, more porting golden advice, more about this on next week's blog.

### The New Architecture Vision

The mentors introduced a brilliant modular approach that addresses the core challenges of the GTK4 migration:

**1. Two Separate Libraries Strategy**
- C Library 'sugar-ext': Core objects and reusable GTK widgets
- Python Wrapper Library: Python widgets and wrapper functions

> Subject to change

**2. Independent Development & Testing**
Each library will be developed in its own repository with simple Python example scripts. This approach offers several advantages:
- Clear separation of concerns between C and Python components
- Easier debugging and testing
- Better CI/CD pipeline management
- Modular, incremental development that reduces complexity

**3. Meson Build System Foundation**
We'll use Meson's shared library template from GNOME Builder as our base. This gives us:
- Modern build system designed for GTK4
- Better dependency management
- Cleaner project structure

### Why This Approach Made Sense

The more I thought about this strategy, the more I realized how elegant it is. Instead of trying to port everything at once (my initial approach, by changing the orignal toolkit and it's systems), we're building a solid foundation that can support the entire Sugar ecosystem. This modular approach means:

- Maintainability — Each component can be updated independently
- Testing — Smaller, focused libraries are easier to test thoroughly
- Future-proofing — The architecture can adapt as GTK continues to evolve
- Support — Due to the new build system, we would have more support and we can also remove things we find deprecated.

## Implementation

Following the meeting  – I immediately got to work implementing. 
The result that came out was [Pull Request #1](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-ext/pull/1) in the new 'sugar-ext' repository.

### What I Built

**Project Structure:**
- Complete Meson build system setup
- GObject Introspection integration for seamless Python bindings
- Initial API implementation (starting with XO Colors for testing)
- Comprehensive documentation and development tools

**Key Technical Decisions:**
```c
// API versioning strategy
api_version = '1.0'     // Maintaining compatibility with existing SugarExt
package_version = '0.122.0'  // Following Sugar's versioning convention

// GIR configuration for Python bindings
symbol_prefix: 'sugarext'
identifier_prefix: 'SugarExt'
```

> This was discussed later in the meet and we decided to keep the packages version 2.0 or 4.0 because GTK4. Will be confirmed by the next blog,

- Included comprehensive build and test scripts

### Testing Framework

The project includes a robust testing setup:
```bash
meson test -C builddir
```

This runs the test suite, validating that the C library builds correctly and the test written should pass.

### To my Fellow Devs

- I have few files that can help you get your setup right. If you like clangd and use it as your LSP. Here's the .clangd configuration I used for sugar-ext.

```yaml
CompileDatabase: ./builddir

If:
  PathMatch: .*\.(c|h)$
CompileFlags:
  Add: [
    -I./src,
    -I./builddir,
    -I/usr/include/gtk-4.0,
    -I/usr/include/glib-2.0,
    -I/usr/lib/glib-2.0/include,
    -I/usr/include/pango-1.0,
    -I/usr/include/harfbuzz,
    -I/usr/include/fribidi,
    -I/usr/include/gdk-pixbuf-2.0,
    -I/usr/include/cairo,
    -I/usr/include/freetype2,
    -I/usr/include/libpng16,
    -I/usr/include/pixman-1,
    -I/usr/include/graphene-1.0,
    -I/usr/lib/graphene-1.0/include,
    -I/usr/include/libmount,
    -I/usr/include/blkid,
    -I/usr/include/sysprof-6,
    -I/usr/local/include/sugar-ext,
    -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
  ]

      bugprone-*,
      performance-*,
      misc-*
    ]
    Remove: [

    ]

- And if you are using VSCode and the C/C++ extension, here's the c_cpp_properties.json.
```json

```

## Lessons from the PR Review Process

- To be added on week 3 as it gets merged!


# Migration List 

- Here Use as-is means if we decide to keep it we use it or it's newer version or alternatives. Port meaning we would have to change stuff, and whenever I have mentioned GTK4 we will use the new API directly rather than implementing from scratch.
