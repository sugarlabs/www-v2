## A Blog-style Retrospective

This week marked a significant milestone in our Music Blocks program engine development as we transitioned from the foundational memory architecture to the core compilation logic. The focus shifted to implementing the AST-to-IR (Intermediate Representation) translation layer - the crucial bridge between our abstract syntax tree representation and executable code.

---

## Goals for This Week

- Complete the AST-to-IR compilation logic technical specification with detailed pseudocode patterns.
- Implement the AST Parsing logic for all expression classes returning instruction lists.
---

## This Week's Highlights

1. **AST-to-IR Compilation Logic Specification**  
   - Expanded the tech spec with comprehensive AST-to-IR translation documentation covering expression and statement compilation patterns.
   - Detailed instruction list generation requirements and variable management strategies.
   - Link: [IR Compilation Logic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_MCCgl-RqiEQH0UQ4EX-2O6G4iRxgHAY1rZpw3QPXT0/edit?tab=t.i655udul8zuq)

2. **Implemented AST Parsing Logic**
   - Developed parsing logic for all expression classes, ensuring they return the correct instruction lists.  

---

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Understanding Static vs Runtime Compilation:**  
  Initially confused about whether we were performing runtime calculations or static code translation.  
  *Solution:* Mentors clarified that this is purely static AST-to-IR conversion with no runtime execution, helping focus the implementation approach.


---

## Key Learnings

- Gained a deeper understanding of static compilation principles and the importance of maintaining clean instruction generation patterns.
- Learned how to effectively manage variable scopes and dependencies during the AST-to-IR translation process.

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Finalize the AST-to-IR compilation logic implementation for all expression and statement classes.
- Begin integrating the IR generation with the memory management system to ensure proper variable resolution.
- Start working on the execution engine that will interpret the generated IR instructions.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to my mentors Anindya, Sumit, Devin, and Walter for their crucial guidance on compiler design principles and static compilation concepts. Their clarification on the AST-to-IR translation approach and emphasis on maintaining clean instruction generation patterns was essential for this week's successful progress.
