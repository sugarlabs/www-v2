## About AI Organizer

AI Organizer (Image Classifier) is an educational activity that introduces students to machine learning concepts through hands-on image classification. The activity uses AI to automatically categorize images into animals, shapes, numbers, or objects, helping students understand how computers "see" and interpret visual information.

*AI successfully classifying an image with confidence scores*

## How to Use

1. **Choose Image:** Click the folder button or "Choose Image" to select a photo
2. **Classify:** Click "Classify Image" to let the AI analyze it
3. **View Results:** See the category, details, and confidence level
4. **Try Again:** Use Clear button to reset and try different images

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Running complex ML models on resource-constrained XO laptops while maintaining responsive performance.

- **Solution:**  
  - Used lightweight, quantized models optimized for edge devices
  - Implemented lazy loading to reduce initial memory footprint
  - Created efficient image preprocessing pipeline
  - Added progress indicators during classification to improve perceived performance

- **Challenge:** Making abstract AI concepts understandable for young students.

- **Solution:**  
  - Designed visual confidence meters instead of numerical percentages
  - Used familiar category names and simple explanations
  - Created interactive tutorials showing step-by-step AI decision process
  - Added "Why did AI think this?" explanations for each classification
