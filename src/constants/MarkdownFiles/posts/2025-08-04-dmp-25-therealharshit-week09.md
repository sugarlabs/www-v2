## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Complete work on the `/debug` endpoint in Sugar-AI.  
- **Goal 2:** Test the debugging response using Sugar-AI on various buggy Python code samples.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Enhanced `/debug` Endpoint in Sugar-AI**  
  - Finalized the logic for better parsing and structured debugging feedback.  
  - Ensured the endpoint outputs clear, concise, and kid-friendly messages.  

2. **Testing with Real Buggy Python Code**  
  - Curated multiple buggy Python scripts ranging from beginner-level mistakes to more advanced logical errors.  
  - Verified that Sugar-AI correctly identifies, explains, and suggests fixes for each case.  
  - Helped improve prompt handling to maintain age-appropriate explanations for kids.
  - Document: [LLM response](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a8GgsccWm9lSuFCWc7yStXzZ3dZW_EIigLyGXseOfjs/edit?usp=sharing)

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Initial debugging responses were too technical for the target audience.  
  **Solution:** Iterated the prompt design and response formatting to make them simpler and more engaging.

---

## Key Learnings

- Deepened understanding of API endpoint design.
- Improved prompt engineering for educational AI tools.  

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Observed that the current responses were too technical, so worked on making them more age-appropriate.
- Tested the debugging responses using a larger language model for improved accuracy.
