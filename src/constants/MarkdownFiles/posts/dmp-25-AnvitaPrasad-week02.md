## Goals for This Week
- **Goal 1:** Design dual-mode tuner interface
- **Goal 2:** Research and prototype cents adjustment UI
- **Goal 3:** Investigate temperament systems and EDO implementations
- **Goal 4:** Implement visual feedback system for pitch detection

---

## This Week's Achievements

1. **Researched Dual-Mode Tuner Design**
   - Analyzed requirements for two proposed tuning modes:
     - Specific Target Pitch mode with fixed reference
     - Arbitrary mode with dynamic Â±50 cents range detection
   - Started working on UI mockups for both modes
   - Researching effective visual feedback systems for pitch deviation

2. **Implemented Initial Cents Adjustment Feature**
   - Created basic manual cents adjustment UI
   - Exploring alternative UI approaches for better user experience
   - Studying various tuner implementations for inspiration

3. **Developed Tuner Visualization System**
   - Implemented center-outward segment lighting system
   - Left/right segments indicate flat/sharp notes respectively
   - Number of lit segments shows pitch deviation magnitude

4. **Pitch Detection System Research**
   - Studied advanced pitch detection methodologies
   - Researched FFT spectrum analysis and phase information evaluation

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Difficulty in accurately detecting pitch in real-time
  **Solution:** Researched and implemented better audio processing algorithms with help from mentor feedback

- **Challenge:** Making the tuner interface user-friendly and responsive
  **Solution:** Studied existing tuner applications and simplified the visual feedback system

---

## Key Learnings
- Gained deep understanding of Equal Divisions of the Octave (EDO) systems and their implementation challenges
- Learned about various temperament systems (Equal, Just, Werckmeister, Kirnberger)
- Studied advanced audio processing techniques including FFT window optimization and spectrum phase analysis
- Researched UX patterns for precise musical instrument tuning interfaces
- Explored different approaches to visual feedback systems for micro-pitch detection

---

## Next Week's Roadmap
- Complete tuner implementation with accurate visualization
- Finalize and implement the selected cents adjustment UI design
- Write Week 03 blog post summarizing progress and learnings
