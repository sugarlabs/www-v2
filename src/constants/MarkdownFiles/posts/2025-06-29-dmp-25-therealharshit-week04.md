## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Design a UI mockup for the debugging terminal.
- **Goal 2:** Develop the debugging terminal in Pippy.
- **Goal 3:** Connected the debugger LLM server with Pippy.
- **Goal 4:** Feed LLM responses into the debugging terminal.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Design a UI mockup for the debugging terminal**  
   - Plan the layout and user experience for how debug tips should appear inside Pippy.
   - Design the UI of the debugging terminal, prioritized clarity and accessibility, especially for children.

2. **Develop the debugging terminal in Pippy**  
   - Added a new Virtual Terminal Emulator (VTE) widget to Pippy using GTK.
   - Integrated the terminal into the existing layout with proper toggling between output and debug views.

3. **Connected the debugger LLM server with Pippy**  
   - Wired up Pippy to make API calls to the FastAPI server.
   - Verified complete flow: `code is extracted → sent to /debug → response displayed in the debug terminal`.

4. **Feed LLM responses into the debugging terminal**  
  - Successfully passed LLM-generated debug suggestions into the terminal.
  - Added simple formatting: newline, spacing, removed markdown syntax elements.

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** GTK app crashing on API call.  
  **Solution:** The crash was due to API response handling on the main GTK thread. I fixed it by offloading the network request to a separate thread using Python’s `threading` module and updating the UI safely with `GLib.idle_add()` to avoid blocking or GTK context violations.

- **Challenge:** Rendering formatted output inside the terminal widget.  
  **Solution:** GTK doesn’t support Markdown, so I simulated structure using spacing, and removed marksown syntax elements to enhance readability.

## Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with Python threading to perform non-blocking API calls and prevent UI freezes or crashes.
- Learned how to work with GTK widgets and using CSS in GTK, especially Gtk.Stack, Gtk.Box, and VTE terminal building responsive interfaces.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Format the LLM response to be more child friendly.
- Develop a custom mardown parser for GTK.
- Begin working on model selection logic and performance optimization.
