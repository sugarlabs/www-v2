**Made PR for Debugger Project**

The debugger project has been complete and a [PR has been made](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4717). The functionalities that have been described in the [previous weeks post](https://www.sugarlabs.org/news/developer-news/2025-06-28-gsoc-25-Elwin-Li-week04) are all included in this PR, and the demonstration video is below:

**Basic Syntax Highlighting**

I've added basic syntax highlighting to the JS editor, making it more pleasing to the eye.
