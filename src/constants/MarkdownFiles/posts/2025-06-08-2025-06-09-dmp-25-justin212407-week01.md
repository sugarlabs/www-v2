# Week 01 Progress Report by Justin Charles

**Project:** [Music Blocks 4 Masonry Module](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4/issues/430)  
**Mentors:** [Anindya Kundu](https://github.com/meganindya/)
**Assisting Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender/), [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/pikurasa)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-06-02 - 2025-06-08

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Figure out the constants required for building the outline of the different brick svgs.
- **Goal 2:** Find out formulae for creation of dynamic parts for the creation of the brick outlines.
- **Goal 3:** Creating functions for rendering different brick types given a set of parameters.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Identified core constants for SVG brick outlines**  
   - Analyzed existing functions to extract constants and segment lengths.
   - Documented fixed edge sizes and arc parameters required for rendering base brick structure. Here is the doc regarding the same - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AUlA2leDJIfV3ZXceLhCaITftExq6c5BcUBMZOtZBvE/edit?usp=sharing
2. **Derived dynamic formulae for brick segments**  
   - Broke down SVG path logic to understand variable-dependent segments (e.g., based on presence of notches or arguments).
   - Reverse-engineered svg paths into configurable logic blocks.

3. **Implemented param-based render logic for brick types**  
   - Created functions to output valid SVG paths.
   - Ensured functions deliver the correct kind of brick based on the parameters given to it.

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Understanding how fixed and dynamic SVG path parts interac 
  **Solution:** Visually inspected path output, compared it to expected segments, and mapped patterns to conditional logic.

- **Challenge:** Ensuring proper rendering across all brick types
  **Solution:** Used example bricks for side-by-side validation; gradually modularized logic to support extensibility.

---

## Key Learnings

- Gained clarity on **brick geometry constants** and their significance in SVG construction.
- Improved ability to **translate SVG paths into conditional logic functions**.
- Strengthened understanding of **segment chaining**, **arc-to-curve translations**, and **parametric shape rendering**.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Complete the path file to begin rendering bricks dynamically via input-driven SVG generation.
- Create React components for different brick types.
- Collaborate with mentors to refine design and implementation plans.
