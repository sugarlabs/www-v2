## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Implementing reliable multiplayer functionality across devices within the Sugar OS ecosystem using `collabwrapper`, while ensuring compatibility with the unique networking and activity-sharing model in Sugar.

- **Solution:** Integrated Sugar’s `collabwrapper` API to manage session joining, data synchronization, and peer discovery. Adjusted the game’s state handling logic to respond to collaboration events, ensuring consistent gameplay across machines. Also performed extensive testing in simulated multi-user Sugar environments to fine-tune message broadcasting and activity resumption.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Fix any feedback provided by members of the organization.  
- Start implementing the Magic moving game.
