## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Improved 'reflection' widget UI**  
  - The three mentor buttons - "Rohan" as a mentor for general purpose, "Steve Job" as the coding mentor and "Ludwig van Beethoven" as the music mentor - have been moved to the sidebar. The buttons are now more visually appealing and easier to access.

  - "Rohan" is set to be the default mentor when the widget is opened. But the other two agents can be selected at any time during the conversation. They will respond in the style of their respective personas and ask relevant questions to their expertise.

  - Connectivity error messages now appear directly in the music block's error message box, ensuring a consistent user experience.

  - Add a minimum message requirement for using the analysis feature. Users now need at least 10 messages in their chat history before accessing it, ensuring the AI has sufficient context to produce a meaningful analysis.

2. **Fixed a bug in sender name display**
  - The sender name was not being displayed after the widget was re-opened. The message history was not storing the names of the agents. Now instead of "assistant", it will store the actual name of the agent.

3. **Simplified first message generation**
  - My mentor suggested that the first message generated by the bot was too complex for children to   understand. It included the project’s algorithm and asked the user to confirm if the guess was correct. The large text could overwhelm users. Therefore, I removed the algorithm from the message. It now simply asks if the guess is correct. This makes it easier for children to understand and respond.

  - The algorithm is still generated but it is kept in the system message. This way, the bot can refer to it later in the conversation if needed.

4. **Changed 'copy to clipboard' button to 'download text file' button**
  - The "copy to clipboard" button was not very useful, as users would have to manually paste the text somewhere. Now, the button allows users to download the chat history as a text file. This makes it easier for them to save and share their reflections.

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Add loading animation while waiting for the bot's response.
- Try implementing streaming responses from the backend.
- I will deploy the backend on Sugar Lab's AWS server.
