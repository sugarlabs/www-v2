## Goals for This Week

- Finalize SVG path logic for all three types of bricks  
- Categorize and document all props passed into bricks  
- Identify all visual states a brick can be rendered in  
- Differentiate props and states across brick types  
- Write comprehensive tests to verify correctness

---

## This Weekâ€™s Highlights

### 1. Full SVG Path Generation Logic

- Completed `generatePath` support for all three brick types (Simple, Expression and Compound)  
- Rendering now properly reflects scaling, argument slots, top/bottom notches, and label widths  
- Edge cases such as bricks with long labels or stacked arguments handled correctly

### 2. Brick Input Prop Categorization

- Catalogued all props across types (`strokeWidth`, `scaleFactor`, `bBoxLabel`, `bBoxArgs`, etc.)  
- Documented their role in layout computation and how they influence final SVG shape

### 3. Brick State Documentation

- Mapped out all possible states a brick can be rendered in (e.g. with/without label, multiple args, missing notches)  
- This will help improve clarity for both debugging and future features

### 4. Type-wise Prop/State Differentiation

- Clearly separated the logic for how each brick type handles its props and rendering states  
- This abstraction allows brick-specific customizations without breaking general rendering flow

### 5. Unified Brick Test File

- Created a comprehensive Jest test file to validate path generation against expected output  
- Covers edge cases like empty arguments, multiple stacked args, and variable heights

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge: Mismatched Bounding Box Heights in Some Brick Types**  
In initial tests, actual brick heights didnâ€™t match the combined heights of `bBoxLabel` and `bBoxArgs`.  
**Solution:** Identified a calculation flaw in vertical layout stacking. Corrected it by properly summing scaled heights and applying consistent spacing logic in path computation.

**Challenge: Supporting All Brick Variants with Shared Logic**  
Bricks share many layout rules, but also diverge in rendering.  
**Solution:** Broke down `generatePath` into side-specific functions (`_generateLeft`, `_generateRight`, etc.) with override support depending on brick type and features like notches.

## Key Learnings

- Improved understanding of scalable vector graphics and path-based layout systems  
- Gained hands-on experience in building testable, modular rendering logic  
- Developed systematic thinking around UI state modeling and prop-driven rendering behavior  

---

## Next Weekâ€™s Roadmap

- Create React Components(View) to render the bricks with all its properties.
- Create the Model components for the different Brick Types.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to my mentors for helping review the rendering logic and for encouraging a structured approach to SVG layout systems. Their early feedback made the path code significantly more robust and maintainable.
