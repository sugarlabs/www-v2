# Final Wrap-Up Report by Saumya Shahi

**Project:** [Masonry Module - Music Blocks v4](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4)  
**Mentors:** [Anindya Kundu](https://github.com/meganindya/)  
**Assisting Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/pikurasa)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-08-10 â€“ 2025-08-24

## Goals for the Wrap-up

- Finalize bug fixes, polish UI, and stabilize interactions.  
- Prepare project documentation and final report.  
- Write retrospective blog summarizing the entire journey.  

---

## Achievements

1. **Final Integration**  
   - Combined **brick rendering, palette, drag-and-drop, disconnections, and AST mapping** into one cohesive system.  
   - Verified functionality across simple, expression, and compound brick types.  

2. **Documentation**  
   - Wrote detailed documentation covering architecture, utilities, and developer setup.  
   - Submitted final report for GSoC archives.  

3. **Community Contribution**  
   - Collaborated with fellow contributors for bug fixes.  
   - Received valuable feedback from mentors on UX design and technical choices.  

---

## Challenges

- Balancing **scope creep** vs. realistic deliverables.  
- Optimizing performance for larger towers with nested bricks.  
- Ensuring seamless UX across all brick interactions.  

---

## Key Learnings

- Designing for **scalability** is as important as delivering features.  
- Collaboration and feedback loops are critical for open-source success.  
- Improved knowledge in **React, SVG, ASTs, and data structure optimizations**.  

---

## Reflections

> GSoC 2025 has been transformative. From learning how to render scalable SVG paths to building a full drag-and-drop visual programming system, this project taught me both technical depth and collaborative spirit.  

This work will help future learners explore music and coding in a playful, powerful way.
