## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Continue developing the `/debug` endpoint in Sugar-AI.
- **Goal 2:** Align backend structure to support clean communication between Pippy and Sugar-AI.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

This week focused on backend development, particularly building and refining the `/debug` endpoint in Sugar-AI. This endpoint serves as the core communication bridge between the Pippy interface and the Sugar's AI inference.

**Key tasks accomplished:**
- Implemented structured request parsing for incoming code and context.
- Designed a response schema that aligns with frontend rendering expectations.
- Added basic error handling and response validation.
- Conducted initial tests to simulate real-time usage from the Pippy Debugger.

Although this week involved less visible UI development, the backend enhancements are vital to delivering a seamless debugging experience.

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Understaing Sugar-AI’s existing API structure.  
  **Solution:** I followed the documentaion and my mentors guidance.

---

## Key Learnings

- Deepened understanding of API endpoint design.
- Ensuring the `/debug` endpoint remains general enough to support various use cases, while still delivering responses formatted for children.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Fully connect the new `/debug` endpoint with Pippy.
- Refine the response output to improve readability and flow for children.
- Start working on saving debug history to Sugar Journal.
