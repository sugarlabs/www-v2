## Progress Summary

The first half of my Sugar Summer of Code 2025 project has been both challenging and rewarding. My project focuses on generating sound samples from prompts. Over the past six weeks, I've made significant progress toward this goal, working closely with my mentors.

- Researched state of art open-source models for generating sound samples from prompts, including [AudioGen](https://audiocraft.metademolab.com/audiogen.html) and [TangoFlux](https://huggingface.co/spaces/declare-lab/TangoFlux).

- Set up the models locally to enable hands on testing and integration.

- Tested the models using various prompts. (High quality sound of dog bark, A natural and rich sound of car horn etc). Saved the sounds samples into Google Drive which was then scored by both the mentors.

- Concluded that the generated sound samples cannot be used directly in Music Blocks, they need to be clipped before integration.

---

## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Find another open-source model to generate high quality sound samples.

---

## This Week's Achievements

1. **Find another open-source model**  
   - I was sucessfully able to find another open-source model [TangoFlux](https://huggingface.co/spaces/declare-lab/TangoFlux). However, after testing several prompts, I realized that these models are unable to generate sound samples suitable for use in Music Blocks. After discussing this with the mentors, we decided that an additional tool is needed, one that can clip audio between specific timestamps. This clipped audio can then be used in Music Blocks, similar to how it's done in Audacity software.

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Create an audio clipping tool.
