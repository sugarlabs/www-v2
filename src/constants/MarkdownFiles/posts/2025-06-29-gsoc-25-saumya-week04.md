## Goals for This Week

- Develop dynamic brick sizing based on content and children
- Create comprehensive validation systems for brick connections
- Establish robust rendering algorithms with proper traversal strategies
- Integrate the complete tree rendering system into the storybook

## This Week's Achievements

### 1. **Advanced Tree Rendering System Implementation**

Developed a brick tree rendering system that handles three distinct connection types:

#### **Stacked Tree Rendering**
- **Vertical Stacking**: Bricks can be connected vertically in sequence below their parent
- **Cumulative Height Calculation**: Total height of stacked trees is calculated by summing individual brick heights
- **Width Optimization**: Stacked trees maintain optimal width by taking the maximum width of all stacked bricks

#### **Argument Brick Rendering**
- **Expression-Only Validation**: Implemented validation ensuring only Expression bricks can be used as arguments
- **Slot-Based Positioning**: Argument bricks are positioned at specific argument slots on their parent bricks
- **Dynamic Slot Management**: Parent bricks automatically adjust their argument slots based on the number of arguments

#### **Nested Tree Rendering**
- **Multi-Level Nesting**: Implemented support for bricks nested inside compound bricks, which can themselves contain nested bricks
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Parent bricks automatically resize based on their nested children's bounding boxes
- **Proper Positioning**: Nested bricks are positioned at calculated connection points within their parent containers

### 2. **Dynamic Brick Sizing and Layout System**

#### **Label Width Adjustment**
- **Dynamic Text Measurement**: Implemented canvas-based text measurement for accurate label width calculation
- **Real-Time Updates**: Brick dimensions update automatically when labels change
- **Fallback System**: Robust fallback for server-side rendering when canvas is unavailable

#### **Child-Based Resizing**
- **Bounding Box Calculation**: Parent bricks recalculate their bounding boxes based on their children's dimensions
- **Compound Brick Layout**: Compound bricks expand their nested regions to accommodate all nested children
- **Automatic Geometry Updates**: Brick geometry updates trigger re-rendering with new dimensions

### 3. **Advanced Rendering Algorithms**

#### **Two-Phase Rendering Strategy**
- **Phase 1 - Preorder Traversal**: Calculate all bounding boxes and dimensions from root to leaves
- **Phase 2 - Postorder Traversal**: Render from leaves to root, ensuring children appear on top of parents
- **Z-Index Management**: Proper layering prevents visual conflicts between nested elements

#### **Bounding Box Computation**
```typescript
function computeBoundingBoxes(allNodes: Map<string, ExtendedTreeNode>) {
  // Preorder traversal for dimension calculation
  // Handles nested, argument, and stacked children
  // Updates compound brick layouts with nested content
  // Returns comprehensive bounding box map
}
```

### 4. **Comprehensive Validation Systems**

#### **Brick Type Validation**
- **Nesting Validation**: Only Compound and Simple bricks can be nested inside other bricks
- **Argument Validation**: Only Expression bricks can be used as arguments
- **Connection Validation**: Ensures compatible brick types for different connection types

#### **Connection Point Validation**
- **Notch Compatibility**: Validates that connecting bricks have compatible notch types
- **Slot Availability**: Ensures argument slots are available before allowing connections
- **Nested Space Validation**: Verifies sufficient space in compound bricks for nested children

### 5. **Brick Model System**

Refined the brick model architecture with advanced features:
- **SimpleBrick**: Basic statement bricks with configurable notches and argument support
- **ExpressionBrick**: Value-holding bricks with expression support and argument-only usage
- **CompoundBrick**: Container bricks with nested children support and dynamic sizing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Advanced Tree Structure
```typescript
interface ExtendedTreeNode extends TTreeNode {
  isNested?: boolean;    // Indicates nested brick
  argIndex?: number;     // Argument slot index
  children?: {
    nested: ExtendedTreeNode[];
    args: ExtendedTreeNode[];
    stacked: ExtendedTreeNode[];
  };
}
```

### Dynamic Sizing Algorithm
```typescript
function updateCompoundBrickLayouts(nodes: Map<string, ExtendedTreeNode>) {
  // Calculate total nested content dimensions
  // Update compound brick's bboxNest array
  // Trigger geometry recalculation
  // Update connection points
}
```

### Validation System
```typescript
function validateBrickConnection(parent: BrickModel, child: BrickModel, type: ConnectionType) {
  switch(type) {
    case 'nested':
      return parent.type === 'Compound' || parent.type === 'Simple';
    case 'argument':
      return child.type === 'Expression';
    case 'stacked':
      return child.type !== 'Expression'; // expression brick can't be stacked
  }
}
```

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them


### Challenge 1: Compound Brick Layout with Multiple Nested Children
**Problem**: Compound bricks needed to accommodate multiple nested children with varying sizes and positions.               
**Solution**: Implemented a two-phase approach: first calculate all child dimensions, then update parent bounding boxes and trigger geometry recalculation. Developed a recursive algorithm that calculates bounding boxes bottom-up, then renders top-down with proper z-indexing to ensure children appear above parents.

### Challenge 2: Label Width Calculation and Dynamic Updates
**Problem**: Bricks needed to resize based on their label text, requiring accurate text measurement and real-time updates.
**Solution**: Implemented canvas-based text measurement with fallback for server-side rendering, and integrated it into the brick geometry update system.
