## This Week's Achievements

###  Wrote Comprehensive Backend Tests with Jest
This week, I focused heavily on **testing the backend** to ensure long-term stability and reliability.

- Created **160 individual tests** ([view them here](https://github.com/BeNikk/musicblocks-backend/tree/main/tests)) covering core API functionality. 
- Used **Jest** for the testing framework, along with **mocking controllers** to isolate logic from external dependencies.
- Tests cover both **happy paths** and **edge cases**, ensuring robust API behavior.
- This significantly improves our **confidence in future code changes** without fear of breaking existing features.

###  Restructured and Improved APIs
In parallel, I revisited some of our backend APIs for **better structuring and maintainability**.

- Refactored route definitions for better **logical grouping**.
- Improved **error handling** and **consistent response formats**.
- Optimized certain request flows to reduce unnecessary API calls.

---

## Challenges & How I Solved Them

- **Challenge:** Maintaining test isolation without hitting actual APIs or databases.  
  **Solution:** Used Jest mocks and stubs for controllers, ensuring tests run quickly and independently.

- **Challenge:** Some APIs had inconsistent parameter handling.  
  **Solution:** Standardized parameter validation and request body structures.

- **Challenge:** Structuring large test suites while keeping them readable.  
  **Solution:** Organized tests by feature/module and used descriptive naming conventions.

---

## Key Learnings

- Mastered advanced **Jest mocking** techniques for controller and service layer isolation.
- Learned the importance of **test coverage as a safety net** for refactoring.
- Refactoring APIs not only improves code quality but also helps onboarding new contributors.

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Continue expanding test coverage to newly added backend features.
- Start preparing **documentation** for the backend APIs.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to my mentors and the Sugar Labs community for their support and feedback during the testing phase!  
This week was a major milestone towards making the backend **production-ready**.  
Looking forward to refining it even further next week.
