## Progress

I am excited to announce that I have been selected for Sugar Summer of Code 2025. This summer I would be working on creating a Generative AI tool that would create endless sound samples that can be then used in Music Blocks.

This week I kicked off my project, I had a meeting with my mentors, and discussed my approach with them. For the next week, it was decided to create a basic frontend using streamlit and for the backend will be using [MusicGen](https://audiocraft.metademolab.com/musicgen.html).

I will begin by testing some prompts and generating some samples from it, to test whether they can be used in Music Blocks or further refinement of the pipeline is needed.
