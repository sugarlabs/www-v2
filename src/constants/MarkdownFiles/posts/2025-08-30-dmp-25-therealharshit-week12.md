## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Work on implementing saving debug history into the Sugar Journal.

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Worked on saving the debugger response in the sugar journal**  
   - Learn how the activity save the data in sugar journal using the `write_file()` and `read_file()` methods.   
   - Current workflow only saves the source tab data, I implimented the logic to also save the terminal data.  

2. **Refactoring of codebase**  
   - Start to work on refactoring my committed code based on mentors feedback.  
   - This ensures seamless integration of Sugar-Ai with Pippy.
