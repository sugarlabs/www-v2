## Goals for This Week

- Finalize SVG path logic for all three types of bricks  
- Categorize and document all props passed into bricks  
- Identify all visual states a brick can be rendered in  
- Differentiate props and states across brick types  
- Write comprehensive tests to verify correctness

---

## This Weekâ€™s Highlights

### 1. Brick Inventory Compilation

- Catalogued different distinct bricks across categories such as Rhythm, Tone, Flow, Graphics etc.  
- Created a centralized metadata list including notches, label types, and slot counts for each.

### 2. JSON Schema for Brick Types

- Authored a strict `bricks-schema.json` enforcing required fields like `type`, `label`, `notches`.  
- Validated all brick entries programmatically and corrected inconsistencies (e.g. naming errors and missing defaults).

### 3. Palette UI Implementation

- Built a dynamic React Palette UI that maps categories and bricks from the schema directly.  
- Enabled hover previews showing live-rendered brick paths and labels.  
- Schema-driven architecture allows zero-maintenance scalability.

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge: Handling Bricks with Special Properties**  
Some bricks (e.g., compound or expression bricks) required special handling due to nested structures, variable slots, or dynamic notches.  
**Solution:** Added metadata flags to the brick definitions (e.g., `hasNotchTop`) and incorporated them into both the schema and UI logic.


**Challenge: Bricks with Ambiguous Labels or Duplicate Names**  
A few bricks had similar or identical display labels, which caused confusion in UI previews and JSON definitions. 
**Solution:** Assigned internal id fields distinct from display labels. The id ensures uniqueness in JSON and tests, while label stays user-friendly in the UI.

## Key Learnings

- Source-code scraping can outperform manual documentation in accuracy and speed.  
- JSON Schema offers powerful safeguards when used with validation tooling.  
- UI scalability improves drastically when tied to a schema-first approach.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to my mentors for helping review the UI and desgin for the palette. Their early feedback made the path code significantly more robust and maintainable.
