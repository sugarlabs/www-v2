## Project Overview

The objective of this GSoC project was to **enhance the existing 3D Human Body Activity** and **create a completely new Stickman Animation Activity** for Sugarizer, Sugar Labs' open-source learning platform. These activities aim to make learning anatomy and animation interactive, accessible, and collaborative, especially for students in low-resource environments.

### Key Deliverables
1. **Enhanced 3D Human Body Activity** - An interactive 3D anatomy explorer with multi-layer visualization, collaborative learning modes, and educational features
2. **New Stickman Animation Activity** - A frame-based animation editor with AI-assisted pose generation, collaborative editing, and export capabilities

Both activities are optimized for Sugarizer's offline-first philosophy and designed to run smoothly on low-power devices while maintaining educational effectiveness.
