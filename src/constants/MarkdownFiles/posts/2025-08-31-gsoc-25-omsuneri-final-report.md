## Abstract

This project presents the development and implementation of an AI-powered debugging assistant integrated directly into the Music Blocks visual programming environment. Music Blocks, as a visual programming language designed for creating music, faces significant accessibility challenges for young learners who struggle with debugging complex block-based compositions. The traditional debugging process requires users to manually trace through their code logic, which can be overwhelming for children and beginners.

This implementation addresses these challenges by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and vector embeddings to provide contextual debugging support specifically designed for educational environments. The system transforms raw Music Blocks JSON project files into human-readable text representations and provides intelligent, conversational assistance that helps users understand their code structure, identify potential issues, and learn programming concepts through natural language interaction.

The debugger addresses the critical need for accessible programming assistance in educational technology, particularly for young learners engaged with visual programming languages, while maintaining the educational scaffolding necessary for effective learning.

## Problem Statement and Motivation

Music Blocks serves as an entry point for many children into the world of programming through music creation. However, the current debugging process presents several significant challenges:

**Complexity Barriers for Young Learners:**
- Traditional debugging requires understanding complex program flow and logic structures
- Visual block relationships can become difficult to trace in larger compositions
- Error identification often requires advanced programming knowledge beyond typical user capabilities

**Educational Accessibility Issues:**
- Limited scaffolding for learners who encounter errors or unexpected behavior
- Lack of contextual help that connects programming concepts to musical outcomes
- Absence of natural language explanation for technical programming constructs

**Technical Limitations:**
- No integrated assistance for understanding block relationships and dependencies
- Limited feedback mechanisms for helping users improve their programming practices
- Insufficient support for educators teaching programming concepts through Music Blocks

**Project Objectives:**
This project aims to bridge these gaps by creating an intelligent debugging companion that provides educational support through conversational AI, making programming concepts more accessible while maintaining the creative and educational value of the Music Blocks environment.
