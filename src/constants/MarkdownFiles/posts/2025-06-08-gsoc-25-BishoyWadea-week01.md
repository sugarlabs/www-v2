## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Define game features and core mechanics.
- **Goal 2:** Design and plan a child-friendly, interactive game UI.
- **Goal 3:** Implement the core game logic for map coloring and rule enforcement.

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Initial Game Implementation**
   - Implemented the basic game loop, event handling, and win condition detection. This created the foundation for gameplay.
   - Added support for checking that no two adjacent regions have the same color.  
   - PR: [#1 Gameplay Base](https://github.com/Bishoywadea/Four-Color-Map/commit/91eabce38439fc08da652d1de309b556393fcee3)

2. **UI Enhancements & Interaction Features**  
   - Designed and integrated colorful buttons, icons, and zoom functionalities to make the UI more appealing to children.
   - Added menu navigation for selecting countries and levels.
   - Added Undo, Erase, and Help buttons for better usability.  
   - PR: [#2 UI Enhancment](https://github.com/Bishoywadea/Four-Color-Map/commit/4fe1c755c47696cc20e6dd757190ed1f3df98717)

3. **Map Data Integration**
   - Generated and added regional map data for Egypt, US, Nigeria, and India.
   - Developed a script to convert GeoJSON files into game-ready polygon data.
   - Screenshot of gameplay:  
   PR: [#3 Data Integration](https://github.com/Bishoywadea/Four-Color-Map/commit/de018722d2d32d3ebd40429f8e59e1793cd34e9c)

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Generating accurate and clean polygon data from raw GeoJSON files.  
  **Solution:** Wrote a custom Python script to extract, simplify, and format the regions into usable coordinates while preserving geographical structure.

- **Challenge:** Preventing adjacent regions from being colored the same.  
  **Solution:** Implemented an adjacency-check function that verifies constraints during each coloring action.

## Key Learnings

- Gained proficiency in using **Pygame** for interactive game development.
- Improved understanding of **map projections** and **GeoJSON** parsing.
- Learned about structuring a project for open-source collaboration (commits, PRs, README, file organization).
- Practiced test-driven logic development and clean UI design tailored for children.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Checking if any bugs appears
- develop broken calculator game
