## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Test the changes and document the entire process.

---

## This Week's Achievements

1. **Test the changes**
    - I tested the changes and discovered a few bugs, which I then fixed.

2. **Create a Dockerfile for backend**
    - I successfully created the Dockerfile of the backend. It was designed so that users or anyone trying to test the backend locally can have a smooth experience without having to manage the dependencies.

3. **Document the code**
    - I completed the documentation of the backend code, wrote the Developer Guide of AI Sample Generation and Audio Trimmer feature in Music Blocks.
    - The User Guide is yet to be written. After discussing with my mentor, we decided to wait until another contributor finishes her work, as she would also be modifying the Sampler Widget UI. Once it is completed, I will write the User Guide.

---

## Key Learnings

- I learned about Docker, including how to write a Dockerfile.

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Deploy the backend on AWS.
- Write a detailed blog post summarizing everything I have done during my 12-week internship.
