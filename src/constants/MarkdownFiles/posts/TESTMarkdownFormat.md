# Comprehensive Markdown Syntax Guide

This document serves as a complete reference for markdown syntax, demonstrating various formatting elements and features supported by our enhanced markdown parser with GitHub-style rendering.

## Headings

# Heading Level 1
## Heading Level 2
### Heading Level 3
#### Heading Level 4
##### Heading Level 5
###### Heading Level 6

## Text Formatting

**Bold text** or __also bold text__

*Italic text* or _also italic text_

***Bold and italic text*** or ___also bold and italic___

~~Strikethrough text~~

==Highlighted text with custom styling==

Super^script^ text and Sub~script~ text

Here's some `inline code` within a paragraph for demonstration.

## Code Examples

### Inline Code vs Code Blocks

Single backticks for `inline code highlighting` like `const variable = "value"` or `npm install`.

### Code Blocks with Language Support

```javascript
// JavaScript example with syntax highlighting
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

const result = calculateSum(5, 10);
console.log(`The sum is: ${result}`);
```

```python
# Python example
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Generate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
for i in range(10):
    print(f"F({i}) = {fibonacci(i)}")
```

```typescript
// TypeScript example
interface User {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    email: string;
}

const createUser = (userData: Partial<User>): User => {
    return {
        id: Date.now(),
        name: userData.name || "Anonymous",
        email: userData.email || "user@example.com"
    };
};
```

```css
/* CSS example */
.markdown-content {
    font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #333;
}

.code-block {
    background: #f6f8fa;
    border-radius: 6px;
    padding: 16px;
    overflow-x: auto;
}
```

```bash
# Bash commands
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
cd repo
npm install
npm run dev
```

```sql
-- SQL example
SELECT users.name, posts.title, posts.created_at
FROM users
JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.user_id
WHERE posts.published = true
ORDER BY posts.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
