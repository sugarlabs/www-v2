## Goals for This Week

- Design and implement a comprehensive brick tree model for managing hierarchical connections
- Implement connection validation based on brick types and notch availability
- Create robust tree management with proper merging and splitting behavior
- Develop comprehensive test coverage for all tree operations

---

## This Week's Achievements

### 1. **Comprehensive Brick Tree Model Implementation**

Developed a `BrickTreeManager` class that handles:
- **Tree Structure Management**: Each tree has a unique ID that changes when connections/disconnections occur
- **Hierarchical Connections**: Parent-child relationships where disconnecting a parent keeps children connected
- **Connection Validation**: Ensures bricks can only connect if their notches are compatible and available

### 2. **Advanced Connection System**

Implemented a dual connection approach:
- **Top-Bottom Connections**: Hierarchical parent-child relationships
- **Left-Right Notch Connections**: Graph-like where bricks connect only if their right and left notches are free
- **Nested Notch Support**: Support for complex nested brick structures
- **Connection State Tracking**: Real-time tracking of which notches are occupied or available

### 3. **Tree Management**

Created tree operations:
- **Tree Merging**: When bricks connect, their respective trees merge into a single tree
- **Tree Splitting**: When bricks disconnect, new trees are formed preserving child relationships
- **Hierarchical Disconnection**: Disconnecting a parent preserves child connections and forms new trees
- **UUID Management**: Each brick has a unique UUID, and trees have dynamic IDs that change with connections

### 4. **Comprehensive Test Suite**

Developed extensive test coverage including:
- **Connection Tests**: Validating proper tree merging when bricks connect
- **Disconnection Tests**: Ensuring correct tree splitting behavior
- **Hierarchical Tests**: Testing parent-child relationship preservation
- **Notch Validation Tests**: Verifying connection rules based on notch availability
- **Edge Case Tests**: Handling complex scenarios with multiple connections

### 5. **Type Safety and Validation**

Enhanced the type system with:
- **Brick Type Definitions**: Clear interfaces for Simple, Expression, and Compound bricks
- **Connection Validation**: Type-safe connection checking based on brick types
- **Notch Compatibility**: Validation ensuring only compatible notches can connect
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for invalid operations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Brick Tree Structure
```typescript
interface BrickTree {
  id: string;
  bricks: Map<string, Brick>;
  connections: Map<string, Connection>;
  rootBricks: Set<string>;
}
```

### Connection Types
- **Hierarchical Connections**: Top-bottom parent-child relationships
- **Notch Connections**: Left-right graph-like connections
- **Nested Connections**: Complex nested brick structures

### Key Features
- **Automatic Tree ID Generation**: Trees get new IDs when connections change
- **Connection Validation**: Ensures only valid connections are allowed
- **Hierarchical Preservation**: Child relationships are maintained during disconnections

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

### Challenge 1: Hierarchical vs Graph-like Connections
**Problem**: Balancing hierarchical parent-child relationships with graph-like notch connections was complex.
**Solution**: Implemented a dual connection system where hierarchical connections manage the tree structure, while notch connections provide the visual puzzle-like behavior.

### Challenge 2: Tree Splitting Logic
**Problem**: Ensuring that disconnecting a parent brick correctly preserves child relationships and forms new trees.
**Solution**: Developed a algorithm that traverses the tree structure, identifies connected components, and creates new trees while maintaining all valid connections.

### Challenge 3: Connection Validation
**Problem**: Ensuring that bricks can only connect when their notches are compatible and available.
**Solution**: Created a comprehensive validation system that checks notch types, availability, and compatibility before allowing connections.

### Challenge 4: Test Coverage
**Problem**: Creating comprehensive tests for complex tree operations and edge cases.
**Solution**: Developed a systematic testing approach covering all major operations, edge cases, and error conditions with clear test descriptions.
