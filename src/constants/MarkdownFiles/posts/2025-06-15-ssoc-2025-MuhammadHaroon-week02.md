## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Set up AudioGen locally.
- **Goal 2:** Create a UI using streamlit.

---

## This Week's Achievements

1. **Set up AudioGen locally**  
   - I was able to set up AudioGen locally for that I followed [AudioGen docs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft/blob/main/docs/AUDIOGEN.md). I also created a virtual environment and a requirements.txt file to make the project easier to run.

2. **Create a UI using streamlit**  
   - I also created a UI using streamlit with the help of the [Streamlit docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** The challenge I actually faced was due to limited resources. AudioCraft (which provides AudioGen) requires a GPU with at least 16 GB of memory for running inference with the medium-sized models (~1.5B parameters). For generating 5 minutes duration of audio, it took around 15-20 minutes.  
- **Solution:** I ran the model and used the waiting time to complete other tasks. I plan to deploy the model on AWS, where I expect significantly better performance.

## Key Learnings

- Gained familiarity with **Streamlit**

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Generate more samples using AudioGen and save them in Google Drive.
