## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Creating an intuitive note-taking interface that doesn't clutter the main game view while remaining accessible to younger users.

- **Solution:**  
  - Implemented a toggle mode system that switches between number placement and note-taking
  - Added clear visual indicators for note mode activation
  - Fixed note button icon for better clarity
  - Used smaller font sizes for notes to distinguish them from actual answers

- **Challenge:** Balancing difficulty levels to ensure appropriate challenge for Sugar's target age group.

- **Solution:**  
  - Created multiple grid sizes (4x4, 6x6, 8x8) with varying pre-filled cells
  - Ensured all generated puzzles have unique solutions
  - Added progressive difficulty that starts easier for new players

---

## Key Learnings

- Gained experience in implementing constraint-satisfaction puzzles with guaranteed unique solutions
- Learned to design multi-modal interfaces (play mode vs. note mode) that remain intuitive for young users
- Improved understanding of Sugar's dialog system and how to create consistent pop-up experiences

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Begin development of new Sugar activity: **Rubik's Cube**
  - Research 3D rendering options compatible with Sugar
  - Design intuitive touch/click controls for cube manipulation
