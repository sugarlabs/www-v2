## Goals for Weeks 05 & 06

- Build robust drag-and-drop utilities for bricks and palette
- Develop a reverse mapping utility to map coordinates to bricks/towers
- Integrate collision detection logic for interactive feedback
- Prepare for next week’s focus on visual feedback and user interactions

## This Week's Progress

### 1. **Drag-and-Drop Utilities for Bricks**

This week, I focused on refining the drag-and-drop experience across both the palette and the workspace.  
- **Unified Drag Logic:** The drag-and-drop system now works seamlessly, whether you’re moving bricks from the palette or rearranging them in the workspace.
- **Component Integration:** Real brick components are now fully draggable and interactable, making the workspace more dynamic.
- **Consistent State Management:** Drag state is now shared and updates are reflected instantly, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### 2. **Reverse Mapping Utility**

I developed a utility that allows us to map any (x, y) coordinate to the corresponding brick and tower.  
- **Efficient Lookup:** The utility uses bounding box and layout data for fast, accurate results.
- **Foundation for Visual Interactions:** This mapping is essential for features like selection, highlighting, and collision detection post processing.

```typescript
function getBrickAtCoordinate(x: number, y: number): { brickId: string, towerId: string } | null {
  // Uses bounding box/layout data to find the brick and tower at (x, y)
}
```

### 3. **Collision Map Integration**

- **Collaboration:** I worked closely with another contributor who implemented the core collision detection logic.
- **Utility Integration:** The drag-and-drop and reverse mapping utilities are now integrated with the new collision map, enabling real-time interaction and hit-testing.

As a side project, I also built a visualizer for collision points on the workspace. While it’s not part of the final product, it was a valuable exercise in visualizing interactions.

## Technical Details

- **Component Reuse:** Brick components are reused across different parts of the app, reducing duplication.
- **Extensible Design:** The reverse mapping utility is designed to support future features like selection and tooltips.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Component and State Reuse:** Reusing logic and state across the app improves maintainability and reliability.
- **Hit Testing:** Building efficient hit-testing utilities is crucial for interactive UIs.
- **Atomic Commits:** I continued to practice atomic commits for better codebase hygiene and easier reviews.
