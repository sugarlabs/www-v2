# Week 05 Progress Report by Aman Chadha

**Project:** [JS Internationalization with AI Translation Support](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4459)  
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/devinulibarri)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-07-01 – 2025-07-07

## Goals for This Week

- Revisit the code submitted in the earlier PR to improve its readability and structure.
- Test the existing implementation thoroughly for stability.
- Refactor parts of the code to ensure it aligns with clean coding practices and is easier to document in the future.

---

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Code Review and Testing**  
   - Went back to the previously submitted PR to review the logic and ensure consistency across modules.
   - Conducted manual testing to verify the correctness of the implemented internationalization functions.

2. **Code Cleanup and Refactoring for Documentation Readiness**  
   - Cleaned up confusing or cluttered code segments and added clarifying comments.
   - Reorganized parts of the codebase to make it easier to follow for future contributors and documentation writers.

## Challenges & How I Addressed Them

- **Challenge:** Understanding and revisiting old logic after a gap in context.  
  **Solution:** Traced execution flows manually and tested sections to ensure functionality still aligns with intended behavior.

- **Challenge:** Ensuring code cleanup doesn’t accidentally break existing functionality.  
  **Solution:** Incrementally tested each change and used sample `.json` files to validate outcomes.

## Key Learnings

- Even small changes in code clarity can have a big impact on future maintainability and onboarding.
- Regular code reviews of your own work are valuable for catching inefficiencies and improving documentation readiness.
- Clean, well-tested code paves the way for a smooth transition to new frameworks like i18next.

---

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Begin integrating i18next into the Music Blocks codebase.
- Replace portions of WebL10n usage with i18next-based equivalents.
- Create helper functions to simplify dynamic translation key resolution using i18next.
- Start documenting the migration process for future contributors.
