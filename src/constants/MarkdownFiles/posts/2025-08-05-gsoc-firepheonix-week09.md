# Week 7 Progress Report by Shubham Singh

**Project:** [Color Sensor for Music Blocks](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/issues/4537)  
**Mentors:** [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/pikurasa), [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-07-21 – 2025-07-28

## Goals for This Week

- Complete the first actual prototype, with the action block export.
- Add vertical lines as a grid, to standardize detection time accross all widths of monitors.
- Find out a method to divide the entire musical pattern into standard column like sections, like in phrase maker.

## This Week's Achievements

1. **Implemented the standardization method of vertical(y) axis**  
   - Earlier, the method of having the lego blocks just across the horizontal axis. Now, the number of pixels across 2 points on any monitor may vary, so we switched to time. But the length of DISPLAY of blocks might also vary.
   - So now, we're using three things: 1. X-axis 2. Y-axis 3. Time
   - Now, the time across any two columns will be the same. Hence keeping it the same across all types of monitors.

2. **Implemented the dynamic dividing of Lego Block images into different shaped columns**  
   - Now, the image detection also automatically detects the column division.
   - This will help significantly in exporting the audio as an action block.

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** The most difficult challenge was figuring out a function that would divide the entire image into different different columns, so that they can be exported as an action block.
  **Solution:** Multiple trials and errors, some mathematical logic, and searched some other resources.
- **Challenge** I was busy with college the entire week.
  **Solution:** Managed my time better, gave more time to gsoc project at weekends.

## Key Learnings

- Break the entire pivot into multiple parts. And then solve step by step. You'll end with a pipeline that gives a LOT more clarity on things.
- Different monitor sizes mean different numbers of pixels between two points. But that difference doesn’t matter if a parameter is hardcoded in pixels (e.g., px) rather than in relative units like vh, vw, %, or em.
- Since different screens have different pixel densities and resolutions, the visual width of the same number of pixels could differ.

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Build the action block output.
- Generate note blocks with their corresponding note values and pitches for a given phrase, based on the LEGO brick input.
