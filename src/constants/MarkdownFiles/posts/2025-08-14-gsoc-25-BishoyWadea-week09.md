## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Ensuring smooth integration of network multiplayer while maintaining Sugar’s UI/UX standards. This included aligning window and pop-up styles with Sugar’s palette guidelines and handling state persistence across sessions.

- **Solution:**  
  - Refined UI elements to follow Sugar’s visual language, including pop-up windows and overall palette adherence.  
  - Made the shared game instance persistent to prevent state loss during gameplay transitions.  
  - Simplified multiplayer by removing the lobby flow, reducing friction for players joining sessions.  
  - Replaced emoji-based rendering with PNG assets for better visual consistency across devices.

## Key Learnings

- Learned how to integrate multiplayer functionality with Sugar’s `collabwrapper` while ensuring proper state synchronization between devices.  
- Developed a better understanding of Sugar’s palette guidelines and how to adapt window designs to maintain a consistent style.

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Address any feedback provided by organization members regarding multiplayer flow, UI alignment, and performance.  
- Begin development of a new Sugar activity **Magic Number Grid**
