# The results for the 2026-27 Sugar Labs board cycle have been determined.


The results for the [2026-27 Sugar Labs board cycle](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/2026-2027-candidates) have been determined.

The winners are **Krish Pandya**, **Walter Bender**, and **Samson Goddy**. They have all been notified and have agreed to serve on the Board of Directors for the 2026-27 cycle. Walter Bender and Samson Goddy were re-elected and Krish Pandya is taking up Claudia Urrea’s seat. Claudia Urrea will continue to serve Sugar Labs as its Treasurer.

Whereas the number of eligible candidates was equal to the number of seats up for election, the Elections Committee opted to forego the formal voting process. Although we are satisfied with the determination, we hope to have more candidates in future elections.

The next election for three seats to the 2027-28 cycle is planned for August of this year. All Sugar Labs members may vote, and members can run for election to the Board of Directors, vote in the elections for the Board of Directors, and suggest referenda. As indicated in the [Sugar Labs Inc. bylaws](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Governance), anyone with "significant and sustained" contributions to Sugar Labs is eligible for membership. If you believe you qualify for membership based on this criteria and are interested in [becoming an official member of Sugar Labs](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Members), you are encouraged to send an email to [members@sugarlabs.org](mailto:members@sugarlabs.org). And if you were a member in the past, but [did not vote in this election](https://www.sugarlabs.org/news/all/elections-extension-december-2025), you will need to reapply for membership in order for your membership status to be reinstated. (If you voted in this election, no further action is required.) Registering for membership early will help ensure that you will be ready for the next election.

And if you are interested in volunteering to assist with the next election in 2026, please contact [volunteering@sugarlabs.org](mailto:volunteering@sugarlabs.org) with your interest.

On behalf of the [Sugar Labs Board of Directors](https://www.sugarlabs.org/leadership), we offer a big *Thank you\!* to all who participated in this year's election.
