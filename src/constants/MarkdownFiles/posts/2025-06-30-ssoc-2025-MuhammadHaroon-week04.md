## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** To further explore the effects of the temperature and top_p parameters.
- **Goal 2:** To find an effective method for removing silence and noise from audio.

---

## This Week's Achievements

1. **Explored the effects of the temperature and top_p parameters**  
   - After experimenting with different temperature and top_p values, I found that AudioGen performs well with temperature = 1 and top_p = 1 values, generating audio that closely matches the prompt.

2. **Found effective method for removing silence and nosie form audio**  
   - I found python libraries for removing silence (pydub) and noise (noisereduce) from the audio and it gave good results.

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Generate more samples using different prompts.
- Explore how to connect backend with the frontend using FastAPI.
- Explore how to deploy the backend on AWS.
