# Weekly Update: Refining Japanese Translations and Repository Workflow

Project: [JS Internationalization with AI Translation Support](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4731)  
Mentors: [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/devinulibarri)  
Week: September 18 – September 25, 2025

## Mentor Feedback on Japanese Translations

This week, I received valuable feedback from mentor **Devin Ulibarri** regarding the Japanese translations. He noted that many of the generated strings were **phonetic translations** rather than proper contextual ones.  

Devin explained that the Japanese language employs three writing systems:  
- **Hiragana** and **Katakana** (phonetic alphabets)  
- **Kanji** (logographic characters derived from Chinese)  

He clarified that in Japanese educational contexts, **kana** (Hiragana/Katakana) is used for younger readers, while **Kanji** is used for more advanced readers. For Music Blocks, we aim to use Kanji where appropriate—so that the translations are natural to fluent readers—while keeping kana for child-friendly UI strings.

## Translation Prompt Refinement

Based on this feedback, I revisited and **refined the translation prompt** used in my Selenium automation script.  
- The updated prompt now encourages GPT to **prefer Kanji** for formal or educational terms while maintaining **Kana** for simpler UI elements.  
- This ensures a more authentic Japanese reading experience while preserving readability for younger learners.  
- I regenerated the `.po` files accordingly with these adjustments.

## Repository Workflow Improvements

I also made workflow-related improvements to make PR reviews smoother:  
- **Branching discipline:** Each language update is now developed in a dedicated branch to ensure clear version tracking and easy merging.  
- **Minimal diffs:** Only affected files are included in PRs to simplify the reviewer’s job.  
- **Transparency in automation:** All strings generated by the AI translation script are now clearly marked with the `Trans-Comment: machine translation` tag in the `.po` files.

These steps improve collaboration and maintain clarity between manual and automated translation contributions.

## Outcome This Week

- Refined Japanese `.po` file generation prompt with better Kanji–Kana balance.  
- Implemented `Trans-Comment: machine translation` markers for transparency.  
- Improved repository branching and commit hygiene for cleaner PR reviews.

## Next Steps

- Re-run Selenium validation with the new Japanese `.po` file.  
- Incorporate feedback from mentors after reviewing the updated PRs.  
- Extend the same translation prompt refinements to other languages.

## Reflection

This week was about **listening, refining, and improving**. Understanding how Japanese writing systems interact with user experience helped me bridge linguistic nuances in AI translation.  
By integrating mentor feedback, enhancing prompts, and tightening repository practices, the project now moves closer to producing culturally and linguistically accurate translations—ready for integration into Music Blocks.
