# Week 09–10 Progress Report by Saumya Shahi

**Project:** [Masonry Module - Music Blocks v4](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks-v4)  
**Mentors:** [Anindya Kundu](https://github.com/meganindya/)  
**Assisting Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/pikurasa)  
**Reporting Period:** 2025-07-27 – 2025-08-09  

---

## Goals for This Period

- Define AST mapping configuration for each brick type.  
- Support translation for multiple AST node types (expressions, statements, functions).  
- Validate execution pipeline by passing ASTs into the engine.  
- Fix bugs and inconsistencies in previous tower logic.  

---

## This Week's Achievements

1. **AST Translation Layer**  
   - Built configuration-driven mapping from **visual bricks → AST nodes**.  
   - Supported 26 AST node types, e.g., `FunctionCallStatement`, `BinaryOperatorExpression`.  
   - Ensured expressions nested within compound bricks translated recursively. 

2. **Bug Fixes & Refactoring**  
   - Refactored tower utilities for more modularity.  
   - Fixed multiple configuration inconsistencies that surfaced during AST export.  

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Recursive expression mapping created circular references in early tests.  
**Solution:** Added validation passes to prune invalid children before generating the AST.  

---

## Key Learnings

- Stronger understanding of **AST structure and compiler pipelines**.  
- Learned importance of **data validation** before execution.  
- Improved debugging skills across **model-view-execution layers**.
