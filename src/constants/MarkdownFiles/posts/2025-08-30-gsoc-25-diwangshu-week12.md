## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Changed mentor name from "Steve Jobs" to "Alen Kay"**  
  - My mentor suggested me to change the coding mentor's name from "Steve Jobs" to "Alen Kay". Steve Jobs, while a significant figure in technology, is not primarily known for coding. Alen Kay, on the other hand, is a pioneer in object-oriented programming and has made substantial contributions to the field. He was also a musician which makes him a more fitting choice for the reflection widget. I have made the necessary changes in the codebase to reflect this update.

2. **Added a refresh button to the widget**
  - A refresh button has been addded to the widget. This button updates the algorithmic summary of the user's Music Blocks project. Now the AI mentors can see the latest changes made by the user. This allows a more dynamic and interactive experience.

3. **Added a 'thinking' animation while waiting for the bot's response**
  - I got inspired by the 'AI debugger' widget and added a 'thinking' animation that appears while the bot is processing and generating a response. This provides visual feedback to users, letting them know that their input is being processed and enhancing the overall user experience.

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- **Goal:** Final testing and bug fixes. The widget is complete and functional. But it needs to be tested with real users to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.
