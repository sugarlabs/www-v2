## A Blog-style Retrospective

This week marked a significant refinement phase in our Music Blocks program engine development as we focused on optimizing the Symbol Table design and laying the groundwork for the execution phase. The primary focus was on identifying and cataloging the IR (Intermediate Representation) instructions that will be implemented, followed by beginning the technical specification for the Interpreter module - the component that will bring our compiled IR code to life.

The Symbol Table modifications were crucial for improving variable resolution efficiency and ensuring proper scope management. Working through the IR instruction identification process helped clarify the execution model and provided a clear roadmap for the interpreter implementation.

## Six-Week Progress Summary

Over the past six weeks, we've built a comprehensive foundation for the Music Blocks 4 Program Engine:

**Weeks 1-2:** Established the core architecture with AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) framework and memory management system, implementing a three-scope hierarchy (Global, Thread, Local) with full CRUD operations.

**Weeks 3-4:** Developed the AST-to-IR compilation logic, creating the crucial translation layer between abstract syntax trees and executable instructions using three-address code format.

**Week 5:** Implemented the Symbol Table and integrated it with the Memory Module for effective variable scope and dependency management.

**Week 6:** Refined the Symbol Table design, identified comprehensive IR instruction sets, and initiated the Interpreter architecture specification.

This progression has taken us from initial planning to having a complete compilation pipeline ready for execution engine implementation.

## Goals for This Week

- Refine the Symbol Table design to improve variable resolution efficiency.
- Identify and catalog all IR instructions that will be implemented in the execution engine.
- Begin writing the technical specification for the Interpreter module.
- Define the interpreter's execution model and core implementation patterns.

## This Week's Highlights

1. **Symbol Table Design Modifications**  
   - Refined the Symbol Table implementation to improve variable resolution performance and scope management.

2. **IR Instructions Identification**  
   - Conducted comprehensive analysis to identify all IR instructions required for the execution engine.

3. **Interpreter Technical Specification**  
   - Started writing the technical specification for the Interpreter module architecture.
