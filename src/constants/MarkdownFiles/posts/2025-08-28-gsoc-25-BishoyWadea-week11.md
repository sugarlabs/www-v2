## About Rubik's Cube

Rubik's Cube is a 3D puzzle game that brings the classic cube-solving challenge to Sugar. This activity helps develop spatial reasoning skills as players rotate faces and manipulate the cube to get each side showing only one color.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Integrating 3D graphics (OpenGL) within Sugar's GTK+ framework while maintaining compatibility across different hardware.

- **Solution:**  
  - Used PyOpenGL with careful context management
  - Implemented fallback rendering for systems with limited GPU support
  - Created custom event handling to bridge GTK and OpenGL interactions

- **Challenge:** Making 3D cube manipulation intuitive for young users unfamiliar with Rubik's Cube notation.

- **Solution:**  
  - Designed visual toolbar with clear icons for each move
  - Implemented mouse drag rotation for natural cube exploration
  - Added keyboard shortcuts matching standard cube notation

---

## Key Learnings

- Gained deep understanding of 3D graphics programming within constrained environments
- Learned to implement complex rotation algorithms and quaternion mathematics
- Developed skills in creating hybrid 2D/3D interfaces that remain user-friendly

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Begin development of new Sugar activity: **Sequence Wizard**
  - Design pattern recognition and sequence completion challenges
  - Implement various sequence types (arithmetic, geometric, visual patterns)
  - Create progressive difficulty system for different age groups
