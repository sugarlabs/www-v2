# Weekly Update: Expanding Language Coverage and Translation Validation

Project: [JS Internationalization with AI Translation Support](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4731)  
Mentors: [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender), [Devin Ulibarri](https://github.com/devinulibarri)  
Week: September 15 – September 17, 2025

## Japanese & Hindi Translation Completion

This week, I successfully generated the full Japanese and Hindi `.po` files using the AI-assisted translation pipeline:  
- Leveraged the RAG context JSON for each UI string to provide accurate, context-aware translations.  
- Ensured that ambiguous strings (e.g., “duck” for pitch vs. volume) were translated correctly with context guidance.  
- Produced fully functional `.po` files ready to be integrated into Music Blocks for Japanese and Hindi users.  

This significantly expands the accessibility of Music Blocks to learners worldwide.

## GPT-Assisted Translation Validation System

To ensure high-quality translations, I developed a Selenium + GPT validation system:  
- Selenium Automation: Loads Music Blocks UI in a browser, extracts all visible strings, and compares them with translated `.po` files.  
- GPT Analysis: Checks whether the translated string preserves the correct meaning, flags potential errors, and generates a summary of questionable translations.  
- Manual Review: Highlighted incorrect translations are then sent to a human translator for verification and correction.  

This system allows us to:  
- Detect translation errors automatically before merging into the main codebase.  
- Maintain a feedback loop between AI translations and human reviewers.  
- Ensure a high-quality, context-aware localization workflow.

## Outcome This Week

- Generated working Japanese and Hindi `.po` files.  
  - [Japanese PR](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4774#issuecomment-3410709064)  
  - [Hindi PR](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/pull/4772)  
- Built a Selenium + GPT pipeline for translation verification.  
- Flagged incorrect translations for review, improving translation accuracy and reliability.

## Next Steps

- Integrate Japanese and Hindi translations into the Music Blocks repository via PRs.  
- Expand GPT validation system to support additional languages.  
- Begin building a translator dashboard to simplify manual review and correction of flagged translations.

## Reflection

This week marked a major milestone: expanding Music Block's localization coverage and creating a robust validation pipeline. By combining AI translations with automated validation and human review, we ensure learners can access Music Blocks in multiple languages with confidence in translation accuracy and clarity.
