# Week 09 Progress Report by Anvita Prasad

**Project:** [Music Blocks - Improve Synth and Sample Features](https://github.com/sugarlabs/musicblocks/issues/4539)  
**Mentors:** [Walter Bender](https://github.com/walterbender)

## Goals for This Week
- **Goal 1:** Extend multi-sample system to violin with string-based sampling strategy
- **Goal 2:** Implement codebase restructuring and proper Git workflow management
- **Goal 3:** Create comprehensive testing framework for violin multi-sample system

---

## This Week's Achievements

1. **Violin Multi-Sample System Implementation**
   - Created violin_multi.js with 6 key violin samples (G3, D4, A4, E5, A5, E6)
   - Implemented string-based sampling strategy optimized for violin timbre characteristics
   - Successfully integrated violin multi-sample into existing system architecture

2. **Codebase Organization and Git Workflow**
   - Created dedicated multi-sample-feature branch to separate work from tuner widget development
   - Successfully resolved merge conflicts when integrating with latest master branch

3. **Enhanced Testing Framework Development**
   - Built violin-multi-direct-test.js for comprehensive violin sample validation
   - Enhanced sample verification system to handle different sample types
   - Implemented thorough boundary testing for smooth transitions between samples

4. **Technical Architecture Improvements**
   - Ensured consistent sample file syntax across piano and violin implementations
   - Fine-tuned MIDI note range boundaries for violin-specific timbre characteristics
   - Implemented robust error handling and comprehensive logging capabilities

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Implementing violin-specific sample selection logic while maintaining system consistency  
  **Solution:** Adapted piano's octave-based approach to violin's string-based strategy with optimized MIDI boundaries

- **Challenge:** Finding high-quality violin samples for different articulations 
 - **Challenge:** Finding high-quality violin samples for different articulations  
  **Solution:** Still continuing to search for better solutions to ensure consistent sound quality across all violin samples

- **Challenge:** Resolving complex merge conflicts when integrating multi-sample code with master branch  
  **Solution:** Manually resolved conflicts by carefully selecting appropriate changes and maintaining code integrity

---

## Key Learnings
- Enhanced understanding of string instrument timbre characteristics and optimal sampling strategies

---

## Next Week's Roadmap
- Implement multi-sample system for additional string instruments (double bass, cello)
- Develop advanced articulation detection and sample selection algorithms
- Optimize performance and memory usage for large multi-sample libraries
- Write Week 10 blog post summarizing progress and learnings
