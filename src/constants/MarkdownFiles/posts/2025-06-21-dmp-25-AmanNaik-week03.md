## Goals for This Week

- **Goal 1:** Develop a working demo of the Story Builder feature  
- **Goal 2:** Implement the demo using Streamlit  
- **Goal 3:** Gather feedback from mentors and plan improvements

## This Week’s Achievements

1. **Developed a Demo of the Story Builder Feature**  
   - Created a functional web application using Streamlit to demonstrate how the story builder AI guides students through storytelling. The demo mimics the question-and-answer-based flow and simulates an AI companion.  
   - Find the demo [here](https://story-builder-ai.streamlit.app/)

2. **Presented the Demo to Mentors**  
   - Shared the working version with my mentors. I received positive feedback and valuable suggestions on what could be improved and how the feature can be enhanced with new ideas.

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

- **Challenge:** Designing a feedback loop where the AI accumulates all context from the student’s responses  
  **Solution:** After repeated iterations and research, I realized that assigning a distinct personality to the LLM helps it collect and remember context more naturally. This personality-driven approach ensures a more engaging and coherent interaction throughout the story-building process.

## Key Learnings

**Built and Deployed a Streamlit Demo to Simulate Story Interaction**  
   - Gained practical experience in using Streamlit to build and deploy web apps that demonstrate AI interaction flow for educational use cases.

**Learned the Importance of AI Personality in Context Retention**  
   - Discovered that crafting an AI assistant with a personality improves its ability to retain context and makes the storytelling experience more relatable and fun for children.

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Begin fine-tuning a language model using AWS  
- Build a system where the AI recommends books similar to the student's story at the end of the conversation
