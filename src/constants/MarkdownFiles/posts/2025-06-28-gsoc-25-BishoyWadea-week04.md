## This Week’s Achievements

### *Goal 1: Fix Issues in Four Color Map Activity*

1. **Make Four Color map game pep8 compliant**  
   - commit: [Make main.py, activity.py PEP 8 compliant](https://github.com/Bishoywadea/Four-Color-Map/commit/45b2dd77e39a6d822d9d4ba0a12fbf1c31e1f04b)

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Implementing precise snapping and collision for 3D puzzle pieces.  
  **Solution:** Designed a snapping algorithm with bounding box checks and added a collision detection system to prevent overlaps.

- **Challenge:** Enhancing the visual quality of the 3D scene.  
  **Solution:** Introduced floor, sky, and object textures; adjusted lighting and shadows for a more polished and immersive look.

- **Challenge:** Allowing intuitive piece manipulation with both keyboard and mouse.  
  **Solution:** Integrated context-aware WASD controls and mouse-based dragging/rotating mechanisms for smooth interaction.

- **Challenge:** Guiding users through gameplay without overwhelming them.  
  **Solution:** Added an on-screen control map, a help button, and a success message to support the player experience.

- **Challenge:** Maintaining code readability during rapid feature additions.  
  **Solution:** Regularly removed redundant code, followed PEP8 guidelines, and modularized logic for easier updates.

---

## Key Learnings

- Strengthened understanding of **3D graphics programming** using transformations, lighting, textures, and real-time rendering.
- Gained practical experience in **interactive puzzle game design**, including snapping mechanics, collision handling, and visual feedback.
- Improved skills in **UI/UX design for educational tools**, balancing usability, clarity, and visual appeal.
- Practiced clean coding habits with **modular design**, PEP8 compliance, and ongoing refactoring.
- Learned to integrate **multi-modal controls** (keyboard + mouse) for intuitive 3D manipulation.

## Next Week’s Roadmap

- Fix any feedback provided by members of the organization.  
- Start implementing the 16-puzzle game.
