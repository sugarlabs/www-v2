# Annual report for 2024

This report is meant to be an overview of the work Sugar Labs did in 2024. Looking back, we did a lot of work. We participated in events in the US and India. We mentored more than a dozen students over the summer for Google Summer of Code and the Dedicated Mentorship Program, the latter of which we participated in for the first time last year.

We launched a series of online videos to showcase our work to the public while simultaneously giving a platform for young contributors to reflect upon their progress and be introduced to a larger developer community. We created a handful of entirely new software projects for learning, such as new math games and Sugarizer activities. We improved our existing software—implementing new features, fixing bugs, and making our learning software available on more platforms. We did all this and more in 2024, which I detail below.

In many aspects, this report is highly personal. I share about my own journeys to conferences, photos of the people I met, and the students to whom I introduced Sugar. In 2024, I became Sugar Labs’s first full-time staff member, which helped me fully dedicate myself to many aspects of the organization. We were also able to sponsor community members like Anindya Kundu to represent Sugar Labs internationally.

As you read this report, please understand that the vision for Sugar Labs as a nonprofit organization is to grow to be able to support more and more people like myself, so we can have an even wider reach. That said, Sugar Labs, being a free/libre/open source community-driven project, makes its tools available to the public under free licenses, so anyone may use what we’ve created to support teachers and classrooms in their communities, regardless of their “status” within the organization.

In other words, Sugar Labs is *not* a one-man-band. Instead, it’s a community of orchestras and ensembles. The organization is meant to support those orchestras and ensembles, comprised of teachers and learners, listening to and responding to their needs.

It is my hope that 2025’s annual report includes even more stories and photos from the broader Sugar Labs community. Sugar Labs welcomes your interest, support, and contributions. I encourage you to join our community of teachers, learners, and parents working together to create better tools and a supportive environment for learning.

I hope the annual publication of our work in the form of an executive summary will serve as a benchmark as we work toward continuous self-improvement as a nonprofit dedicated to serving our community of teachers and learners.

## Development in 2024

### Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and Dedicated Mentorship Program (DMP)

As for our work this summer, Sugar Labs participated in our fourteenth Google Summer of Code (GSoC) to assist students in working on [eleven projects](https://www.sugarlabs.org/press/2024/05/01/Sugar-Labs-receives-eleven-contributor-projects-for-GSoC-2024/). This, combined with our first-ever participation in Code4GovTech’s Dedicated Mentorship Program (DMP), advanced our software development, mentoring a total of fourteen students who worked an estimated five thousand hours on projects ranging from maintaining and porting twelve activities to Flatpak, to creating new math games, to promising new generative-AI services for both teachers and learners.

To get a better sense of all that we accomplished this summer, you are encouraged to watch the Finale series of students’ presentations on our YouTube channel at [https://www.youtube.com/@SugarlabsOrg-EN](https://www.youtube.com/@SugarlabsOrg-EN).

We also encourage you to check out the work in more detail by reading the reports published on Medium:

## Outreach and communications

### Online events

In 2024, I started a series of live events online where past and current contributors and students have a platform to tell their stories, as well as invite guests from other organizations to discuss the future of technology in education.

I did this because, although Sugar Labs’s impact is obvious to many in the community, I’ve found that there are still many untold stories from community members whose lives have been impacted by our work. Publishing these stories has continued to affirm the important role Sugar Labs plays in education.

For example, in [my interview with Ibiam Chihurumnaya](https://youtu.be/JLsUiVzZ5Z0), he shared how the Sugar Learning Platform and community introduced him and his classmates to programming from a young age and gave him skills he continues to use to this day.

### Expanded social media presence

Last year, we expanded our presence on social media. In addition to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn, we are now on Bluesky, WhatsApp, and my personal favorite, Mastodon.

If you are on any of these platforms, please follow Sugar Labs and boost our posts to support our outreach. If you're interested in helping with our outreach, join our marketing mailing list and express your interest: [https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/marketing](https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/marketing).

### Reboot of regular newsletters

In 2024, we relaunched regular newsletters, now sent approximately once every three months. These newsletters share our progress as an organization and news valuable to our community:

- [https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/09/20/sweet-spot/](https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/09/20/sweet-spot/)
- [https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/12/29/sweet-spot-002/](https://www.sugarlabs.org/community/2024/12/29/sweet-spot-002/)

### Newsletter email subscription

Our newsletters are published to the website and also sent via email. In 2024, we started using Buttondown to send newsletters to subscribers worldwide. If you’re not subscribed yet, please do so: [https://buttondown.com/sugarlabs](https://buttondown.com/sugarlabs).

### Reboot of Sugar Stories

In 2024, we began collecting stories from our community. While it’s still early, we’ve already received some fantastic articles.

- From [James Simmons](https://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/user/45): [Helping others to create their own Sugar Activities](https://www.sugarlabs.org/stories/2024/09/13/Writing-new-Activities-and-sharing-sugar-with-youth/)
- From me: [Reflections as Parents and Teachers](https://www.sugarlabs.org/stories/2024/12/25/Reflections-as-Parents-and-Teachers-Sugar-at-home-and-in-their-classroom/)

You can read these and more at: [https://www.sugarlabs.org/sugar-stories/](https://www.sugarlabs.org/sugar-stories/)

If you have a story, share it via [info@sugarlabs.org](mailto:info@sugarlabs.org) or through the mailing lists:

- Education: [https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/iaep](https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/iaep)
- Development: [https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/sugar-devel](https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/sugar-devel)

### Major improvements to our website

Throughout 2024, I worked on updating our website, which needed attention. Being unfamiliar with Jekyll (the framework it’s built on), I struggled at first, but with help from the free software community, I learned enough to begin publishing updates more regularly.

Near the end of the year, more folks from the development community pitched in. Now, the site is in much better shape, and we are working toward a completely revamped version set to launch in April 2025.

Thanks to the many volunteers who helped! Interested in joining the web team? Visit [https://matrix.to/#/#sugarlabs-web:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#sugarlabs-web:matrix.org).

### Conference talks

In 2024, we sent representatives to a few in-person conferences. With limited budget, we focused on visibility, sending me to several conferences in the US and sponsoring Anindya Kundu to represent us at the Opportunity Open Source Conference at IIT Kanpur.

### - LibrePlanet

In May, I attended the Free Software Foundation’s annual LibrePlanet conference in Boston, MA. There, I [handed out flyers](https://mstdn.io/@codewiz/112384505018899979) and showed off a computer running the Sugar Desktop Environment.

### - 2024 Micro Camp

In June, I spent a weekend at a 2024 Micro Camp, a retreat for microtonal musicians, where I showcased the Music Blocks visual programming language. Music Blocks, a flagship Sugar Labs project, has rich microtonal capabilities. I showcased those features during one of the first talks of the retreat, and I even used Music Blocks as a musical instrument to perform a piece of music that requires twenty-two divisions of the octave—something for which I did not have a capable physical instrument, except for [a programmed instrument I created within Music Blocks](https://musicblocks.sugarlabs.org/index.html?id=1719093905649087&run=True).

At the conference, I was also pleasantly surprised to meet so many free/libre/open source developers and educators. A large percentage—much larger than at most music conferences—were developing software. In retrospect, it makes sense that there are so many microtonalists who develop software, because these musicians typically need to create instruments that play pitches differently from what you would find in most stores, and they use both physical and digital mediums to craft such unique instruments.

### - CMK

In July, I attended Constructing Modern Knowledge (CMK), a retreat for teachers, in Manchester, NH. This retreat is a good fit for Sugar Labs as it is focused on Constructionism. CMK brings together passionate educators from around the world to work on new and creative projects, which they bring back to their respective schools.

### - FOSSY 2024

In August, I attended FOSSY, hosted by the Software Freedom Conservancy, in Portland, OR. I gave a talk titled “[Mentoring youth: The FOSS strategy we've been looking for](https://2024.fossy.us/schedule/presentation/202/)”. You can watch the talk on our YouTube channel at  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKBXSC9Veq8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKBXSC9Veq8).

I also ran two Birds of a Feather sessions. One was a Music Blocks workshop, where Bryan Ollendyke of [HAX](https://hax.psu.edu/) tested the limits of the JavaScript editor in Music Blocks. The other was a free/libre/open (FLO) music concert, where I joined [Aaron Wolf](https://blog.snowdrift.coop/author/wolftune/), [Timmy Barnett](https://gnulinux.love/), [Kite Giedraitis](https://tallkite.com/), and others to showcase [FLO](https://wiki.snowdrift.coop/about/free-libre-open) through instruments, software, and a variety of music.

### - Internet-in-a-box demonstration

Also in August, I attended a meetup to demonstrate [Internet-in-a-box](https://internet-in-a-box.org/) (IIAB), led by [Adam Holt](https://github.com/holta). Kids and teachers got an opportunity to see what IIAB does and to try it. [Sugarizer](https://sugarizer.org/), the web-based version of the Sugar Learning Platform, is among the packages chosen for IIAB, which empowers schools to use learning services that would otherwise require an internet connection.

### - GSoC Mentor Summit

Sugar Labs has participated in GSoC almost every year since 2009. This year, we worked on a number of projects. I was sent to represent Sugar Labs at the conference, hosted at Google headquarters. I met with other mentors, attended talks, and gave a lightning talk on our unique approaches to mentoring.

## Sugar Labs in the Classroom

### Music Blocks

This year marked significant progress in research and development for the Music Blocks visual programming language. Alongside the development work done during GSoC over the summer, I explored every opportunity to bring the new features to students, teachers, and classrooms.

I collaborated with one of my students, Nathan, who has studied music with me for about a decade and has also taken over a year of Music Blocks classes directly from Walter Bender. Together, we tested the new AI features, such as MIDI import, as well as experimental features like music transcription and lesson plan generators.

During the same period, I worked closely with teachers who were preparing innovative Music Blocks lessons. They provided valuable feedback by reporting bugs and suggesting new feature requests based on their classroom experiences.

### Sugar Learning Platform and Sugar Activities

In the fall, I began teaching a small group of kindergarten and first-grade students using the Sugar Learning Platform. We started with a few One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) laptops and later transitioned to newer hardware. The students quickly fell in love with their computers — calling the chat robot their "robot friend" — and eagerly created art, composed music, and played educational games.

Our sessions covered a variety of topics, from spelling to problem-solving. The foundation we built early on eventually led to the students learning to program using Turtle Blocks. The class is ongoing, and it has been both a joy for the students and an insightful experience for me.

Additionally, my time in the classroom has allowed me to provide valuable feedback to developers for future improvements to the platform.

### Teaching Git to Students of Everett High School

In the spring, a couple of teachers at a local high school approached me about training their students in collaborative software development practices. I met with the students twice and followed up with them via email and group chat to support their learning journey.
Together, we covered the basics of Git version control, using the command line, and making their first contributions to our repositories. It was a rewarding experience that gave the students practical skills and an introduction to open source collaboration.

## Finances

Last year, I spent time working on our finances — where we keep our money, which platforms can be used to donate to our organization, and increasing the number of financial tools available to us. I did this work primarily to ensure that charitable donations can be made with confidence, ultimately helping every contribution we receive go further.

One of the major improvements I made to increase financial transparency was updating and publishing our 990 tax filings. All of our tax documents are now up to date and publicly available on our [donations page](https://www.sugarlabs.org/donate/) under the section "Our 990 tax filings."

In addition, I helped Sugar Labs secure in-kind services that directly support our day-to-day operations at no cost. This year, we received:

- **Open Source Credits from AWS**: These credits are helping us test and develop new educational software.
- **Over 100 terabytes of data storage** through Google Workspace for Nonprofits.
- **Other in-kind services** that allow us to run more efficiently and at a lower cost.

Lastly, I laid the groundwork for accepting financial contributions through a wide variety of platforms, including ACH, stocks, and even cryptocurrency. We were also added to the PayPal Giving Fund, which makes us discoverable through multiple corporate donation programs. Employers can now support Sugar Labs via Benevity, and all these channels are now live as of 2025 — a result of the foundational work completed in 2024.

### AWS Open Source Credits

In 2024, we applied for and were awarded **open-source credits worth $8,000** from Amazon Web Services (AWS). These credits will help us continue testing and developing the large language model (LLM) and neural network services we worked on over the summer.

### New Sugar Labs Merchandise for Sale

We added a fun twist to our fundraising efforts last year! Inspired by the community reaching out with questions like *"How can I buy Sugar?"*, we launched a variety of branded merchandise.

We now offer:

- **Clothing items** – Hoodies and t-shirts in a range of colors.
- **SoaS (Sugar on a Stick) USBs** – Bootable drives ready for use.

To minimize overhead and simplify logistics, we partnered with two trusted vendors:

- [**Bonfire**](https://www.bonfire.com/store/sugar-labs/) for apparel  
- [**USB Memory Direct**](https://www.usbmemorydirect.com/) for USB drives

All proceeds directly support Sugar Labs’ mission to create educational software based on Constructionist learning principles.

## Membership

In 2024, we made one significant change to how membership is maintained. In preparation for our annual election, we required community members to reapply for membership to ensure active participation, as our [bylaws](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Governance) require a majority vote from members for some decisions.

Aside from this participation requirement, the eligibility criteria remain unchanged:

> “Any ‘significant and sustained’ contributor to Sugar Labs is eligible for membership... Contributions may be code, documentation, translations, maintenance of project-wide resources, running a Sugar deployment, or other non-trivial activities which benefit Sugar Labs.”

If you're an active contributor — technical or non-technical — we encourage you to [apply for membership](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Members). Membership gives you the right to vote in board elections and other key decisions.

## Management and Board

In 2024, [Devin Ulibarri was appointed Executive Director](https://www.sugarlabs.org/press/2024/05/08/Sugar-Labs-announces-nonprofit-status-new-executive-director/). Alongside his leadership, our membership also voted in three new board members, as noted in the section above, including one seat that had been previously vacant.
