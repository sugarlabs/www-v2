## A Blog-style Retrospective

This week I worked on creating a TechSpec for the Interpreter and then Created a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to visualize the data movement within the system.

---

## Goals for This Week

- Create a TechSpec for the Interpreter.  
- Create a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Interpreter.  
---

## This Week's Highlights

1. **TechSpec Creation**  
   - Developed a comprehensive TechSpec for the Interpreter, detailing its architecture, components, and interaction with the Symbol Table and Memory Module.
   - The TechSpec serves as a blueprint for the implementation of the Interpreter, ensuring clarity in design and functionality.

2. **Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Creation**  
   - Created a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to visualize the data movement within the Interpreter.
   - The DFD highlights key processes, data stores, and data flows, providing a clear overview of the system's operation.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Defining the Interpreter's Architecture:**  
  Faced challenges in clearly defining the architecture and components of the Interpreter.  
  *Solution:* Collaborated with mentors to refine the TechSpec, ensuring it accurately reflects the intended design and functionality of the Interpreter.


---

## Key Learnings

- Gained insights into the process of creating a TechSpec for complex systems, focusing on clarity and detail.  
- Learned how to create a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to visualize data movement and interactions within the system, enhancing understanding of the Interpreter's operation.

---

## Next Week's Roadmap

- Start working on the implementation of the Interpreter based on the TechSpec and DFD.  
- Begin coding the first components of the Interpreter, focusing on integrating it with the Symbol Table and Memory Module.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to my mentors Anindya, Sumit, Devin, and Walter for their crucial guidance on compiler design principles and static compilation concepts. Their clarification on the AST-to-IR translation approach and emphasis on maintaining clean instruction generation patterns was essential for this week's successful progress.
