# About Mebin Thattil

Hey, I'm Mebin üëãüèª! I'm a first year student at PES University, Bangalore, India, currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science. I‚Äôve had a deep passion for tech ever since I was 10, when I first learned in a CS class that you could write a couple of lines of code and build a (barely functional) website. That simple idea sparked something in me, and over the years, my love for computer science has only grown‚Äîespecially while building a bunch of cool things along the way.

I'm going to spend my summer working on the [Speak Activity](https://github.com/sugarlabs/speak). I will be refactoring the chatbot in the speak activity to use Gen-AI.

About a month ago, I launched my personal portfolio website: [mebin.in](https://mebin.in/). It runs on an 8-year-old Raspberry Pi sitting at home ü§©, so apologies in advance if the site is occasionally slow or down (power cuts are a real pain). I ocassionally write blogs there.

I'm also building a Bluesky client in the Nim programming language. I'm a strong advocate for education in technology. In the past, I built a web application aimed at connecting students in rural areas with those in urban areas to help foster a free and open peer-to-peer learning ecosystem.
