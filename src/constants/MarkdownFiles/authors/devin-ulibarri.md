# About Devin Ulibarri

Devin Ulibarri is a versatile musician with a diverse portfolio. He
has compositions published in Conceptions Southwest magazine, a range
of teaching experience—from preschool to college-level—and has
performed with artists such as Silk Road Ensemble with Yo-Yo Ma.

He holds two college degrees in music, a BM and MM in Classical Guitar
Performance from the University of New Mexico and New England
Conservatory. There, he studied under the tutelage of world-renowned
musician, Eliot Fisk, who he has continued to work closely with for
the Boston GuitarFest (2010-present) and publication-assistance
(SoundBoard Magazine).

Devin Ulibarri’s multitude of interests include Nichiren Buddhism and
the study of the Japanese language—which have culminated through
commissions of new works from promising composers such as Emi Inaba of
Berklee College of Music and Nell Shaw Cohen.

An accomplished and innovative teacher, Ulibarri has his own guitar
book for the pre-reading level. He also has a thoughtful and engaging
work, “Thinking Beyond the Myths and Misconceptions of Talent,”
co-authored with Larry Scripp and Rob Flax, which was received by
Tanglewood’s Allen Fletcher as “an immensely consequential
investigation of an issue at the heart of society, and a call to
effective action.”

From 2016-18, Devin served as faculty for the Preparatory and
Continuing Education schools at New England Conservatory and is
co-creator of Music Blocks, a visual programming language for
exploring music’s fundamental concepts. Music Blocks is currently
being considered for Japan’s national coding curriculum in 2020. Music
Blocks development for 2020 is being done in partnership with Gakken,
a major Japanese publishing company with funding from Japan’s Ministry
of Economics Trade and Industry.
