# About Aman Naik

I’m someone who loves building smart tools that make life a little easier—whether it’s a chatbot that talks like Lord Krishna or a system that helps forecast real-time prices. I’ve explored everything from AI and machine learning to satellite data and creative writing prompts. I enjoy blending tech with storytelling, finding joy in both solving real problems and crafting meaningful experiences. For me, coding isn’t just logic, it’s a way to create things that connect with people.
