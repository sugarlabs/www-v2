# About Me

I am a first-year undergraduate student who recently started contributing to open-source projects. I am interested in frontend development and learning how real-world software is built collaboratively.

## Experience

I recently started contributing to Sugar Labs by setting up the www-v2 website locally and understanding the project structure. This helped me learn how open-source teams manage documentation, code reviews, and contributions using Git and GitHub.

## Current Projects

- Exploring contributions to the Sugar Labs website (www-v2)
- Learning Git, GitHub, and frontend development best practices
