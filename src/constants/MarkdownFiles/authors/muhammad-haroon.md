# About Muhammad Haroon

Hi, I’m Muhammad Haroon, a final year student at NED University Karachi, Pakistan, pursuing a degree in Computer Information & Systems Engineering.

I have been actively contributing to Sugar Labs for a long time not just in code, but also in documentation and by assisting new contributors.

This summer, I’ve been selected for Sugar Summer of Code (SSoC) 2025. This is the first time Sugar Labs is running this program, and I’m proud to be a pilot candidate. I’ll be working on Generative AI Instrument Sample Generation for Music Blocks, which will give students endless options for sound samples.
