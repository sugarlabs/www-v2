# About Krish Pandya

I'm Krish, aka MostlyK, a B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIITH. While my degree might say ECE, I've completely fallen down the open source rabbit hole. I believe in doing things right the first time, even if it takes longer, and I approach problems by understanding the "why" behind changes, not just the "what."

## Experience

- Systems engineering and graphics programming
- Open source development and contribution
- C/Python development
- Linux and System Adminstration

## Current Projects

- **GSoC 2025**: GTK4 migration for Sugar Labs desktop environment
- Modular architecture and newer build system design for Sugar
- Sugar-AI and it's implementation along with other fun stuff.
